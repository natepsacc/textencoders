Adam Curtis is the bomb dot com.
Watched the day of the lotus tonight. Crazy ending
You really should, I think you‚Äôd appreciate Curtis‚Äô POV.  Josh has screened *The Century of the Self* which was well received by the community.  It‚Äôs a great place to start as well as *Bitter Lake* and especially *Hypernormalization.* I imagine Curtis‚Äô work has had some influence in the trajectory as to how I and many others ended up in this space.
Here‚Äôs most of his work. https://thoughtmaybe.com/by/adam-curtis/

There‚Äôs like a montage of him trying to pick up girls in Portland Oregon and when he says he‚Äôs a veteran they‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh so you have a white savior complex‚Äù

yeah that perfectly articulates it. I feel like I‚Äôm so desensitized to dumb Marvel shit at this point but I‚Äôm still sort of puzzled by how films like Dog can exist. Ik there have always been box office flops but it really feels like there‚Äôs so much unwatchable content right now
l cannot imagine watching anything I saw commercials for aside from maybe as a free movie on a southwest flight

It‚Äôs weird to hear strangers laughing when the only way I‚Äôve watched movies was alone or in small groups
Reactions
For the last few years
yeah at this point if I‚Äôm gonna go to the movies it‚Äôs for some kind of the communal experience
I feel like really leaning into that aspect of it would be interesting
ya theatres r peculiar cuz it always feel so communal even tho you don‚Äôt rly interact with the other viewers that much. it still feels distinctly different than watching something alone or with a small group even tho it‚Äôs just like ‚Äòstrangers‚Äô in the dark. makes me think of dance clubs as well.
Nah Cyrano looks fun Peter Dinklage rocks and I like the OG play

It was pretty to look at but story wise, it was very meandering
It was an interesting update to the character but also I‚Äôm entering a sort of anti-Hollywood phase in my film knowledge. American films don‚Äôt surprise me anymore
You'll get over that.
In the future all movies will be part of a cinematic universe. I have embraced this cynical future and I'm glad they're making more than just superhero movies. This was like a mystery thriller. The cabal is rediscovering genre.
That's why Matrix Resurrections was so good because they allowed anyone to make any movie in that cinematic universe because it's not "about" anything specific
Found myself enjoying Edge of Tomorrow far more than I initially expected I would

Anti super hero movie being minimal action and more introspective character development etc

Bob lookin hella strange in this tbh
Didn‚Äôt need the last like mins but the rest was pog as fuck
I enjoyed it more than joker that‚Äôs for sure
i was straight up so bored for most of the movie, i nearly fell asleep
didn't care about any of the crime drama really
there were some really great moments but like half the movie was medium close up/close up shots of someone talking
idk maybe i am being too harsh but i really thought it was mediocre but the stylistic choices were very dialed in, some really cool world building and some god awful acting from the kravitz chick. really collin ferrel and the dude that played riddler autistically carried the cast
There was some terrible acting
Pattinson is overrated ngl
Dano shined hard tho
hate to say i agree
noooo
hes so sexy......
although i liked him in the lighthouse

I will give my review in days when I can stream at home

Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the obvious sequel setup too

It felt like they meant to cut a lot of the ending but just didn‚Äôt. The whole last mins every scene felt like it was gonna end there but then didn‚Äôt

they are fully going to make a fucking joker movie again lmfao
Shit looked expensive as hell they probably just didn‚Äôt wanna lose their investment

I thought Danos little vlog was cute
Was kinda rooting for him ngl
the fucking cheesy ass online radicalization plot
He‚Äôs just like me fr
some of the writing was so damn bad and i am unsure if that is just them being reverent to an old comic book and then it not translating to screen or what
Yea I was the only dude laughing at points cuz parts were like bruh seriously? You spent this much on this just to get some year old dweeb to pry this bit in?
lol
Also I don‚Äôt think anyone else caught the part where penguin was waddling. Disappointed in that crowd
i loved the riddler character and was very much on board with him until one line at the end where he || is mad at bruce wayne for being a cooler orphan than him ||

Also I hate to be that guy but it seemed like they went for a realism vibe at times but then completely abandoned it at others. Like bruh he has internal bleeding

my theatre was full of kids and their parents
running to pee times
because the movie went on times as long as the longest video they have watched in their short lives
Literally a of their whole life so far was spent confused at why Batman is doing that
i can't stress enough how stupid it is that that movie was so long. it felt so self indulgent
no more long movies im retarded

Yea my ass hurts lol
i was so mad that the car showed up in the preview. my favorite thing was when it jumped through the fire and i already saw it like every weekend for the past months in previews
i wouldve been fine with just the first scene of him on the motorcycle with nirvana playing and one shot of him with the heavy makeup
i will say the title card was GOATED

That would‚Äôve slapped way harder

That actor kills it in everything I forget his name
I did like the lack of stupid bat voice
i love the stupid bat voice
Also the catwoman romance arc felt unnecessary and stupid I thought they‚Äôd throw a curve ball and skip that this time
they honestly did not need the catwoman character in that movie

Fr, although I think the parts that were supposed to create some sort of ironic distance (as apposed to spoon fed comedic relief) were overlooked because people are so used to obvious laugh cues and didn‚Äôt want to seem like weirdos.

it had a very i support the current thing / tax the rich dress energy the way it just lazily had catwoman say some shit about how powerful men suck or whatever

I feel like he started out loving the system he‚Äôs always been super pro cop and pro Justice-system
If anything the arc was more about learning to help and believe in people rather than just being feared by criminals
And I guess having hope in the possibility of change could be interpreted as loving the system, but I think it was more about like believing there are good people who want to do good
Yea fear isn‚Äôt as valuable as a tool as hope is or something cheesy like that
More of a sentimental thing than a political one imo
Hard to make a mainstream film with ‚Äòreal political implications‚Äô without getting cancelled by half ur target demographic so u gotta resort to cheap moral shit (like everything else)

Chris Marker‚Äôs level is screening at metrograph  this week ‚Äî
*A woman (Laura), a computer, an invisible interlocutor: such is the setup on which LEVEL FIVE is built. She ‚Äúinherits‚Äù a task: to finish writing a video game centered on the Battle of Okinawa ‚Äì a tragedy practically unknown in the West, but whose development played a decisive role in the way World War II ended, as well as in postwar times and even our present.
A strange game, in fact. Contrary to classical strategy games whose purpose is to turn back the tide of history, this one seems willing only to reproduce history as it happened. While working on Okinawa and meeting through a rather unusual network ‚Äì parallel to Internet ‚Äì informants and even eye-witnesses to the battle (including film director Nagisa Oshima), Laura gathers pieces of the tragedy, until they start to interfere with her own life.
As in any self-respecting video game, this one proceeds by ‚Äúlevels‚Äù. Laura and her interlocutor, intoxicated by their enterprise, use this as a metaphor for life itself, and gladly attribute levels to everything around them. Will she attain LEVEL FIVE?*
oh shii i gotta go

i‚Äôm also so interested in this (spectacle theatre nyc) https://www.spectacletheater.com/random-man-presents-psychology-today-by-extreme-animals/
‚ÄúIn information theory, the repetition of messages tends towards the obliteration of meaning. This theorem is vitally demonstrated in Extreme Animals‚Äô video Psychology Today, which traces the algorithmically accelerated decomposition of images from the post-millennial cultural imaginary: Shrek, the Joker, and other depressive icons of our interminable financial crisis inspire a legion of exhausted reenactments by children‚Äôs birthday party workers and freelance Blender artists. Interwoven with motivational programming staged at depreciating levels of conviction, the final assembly speaks not so much to the experience of overstimulation as to the unique combination of sensory hypertrophy and apathy characteristic of life
This is presentation is the first of a collaboration between Spectacle and the Queens-based art publisher Random Man Editions, which specializes in broadcasting various genres of the indescribable and documenting fringe practices across analogue and digital media. More information available at randomman.net.‚Äù

Funny to see Girls mentioned there
I didn‚Äôt think they were particularly popular, even amongst millennials
Also, the last slide in this list features media that is far more representative of Zoomer culture than it is of millennial culture
Euphoria is not targeted towards a millennial audience, nor does it speak to the millennial experience
I agree that there‚Äôs a core list from mid - mid that probably held influence over majority millennials, however after the there are splits that a broad list can‚Äôt track.
Yeah, it‚Äôs nonsense
I feel like the soundtrack to that show alone is enough to say it is targeted to millennials, but I agree it doesn't speak to the experience.
I‚Äôm not at all aware of the soundtrack - any notable selections?
There's a lot of tracks from the bling hip hop era, that I don't think any zoomers have a relationship to.
However I say this as a capital M Millennial, so I may be wrong.
I think that show is trying to allow millennials who are desperately trying to maintain cultural relevance the opportunity to feel like they can understand and partake in zoomer culture.
Yeah there was some weird soundtrack stuff on euphoria where they are having parties and the soundtrack is rap music that would've been played at millenial high school parties
Also every millenial woman, enby and/or gay I know watches it

Ultimately none of these films played on IFC after midnight between and therefore do not speak to my (admittedly obnoxious) experience

Has anyone else seen X yet? Curious to hear any thoughts about it
I saw X at a local theatre and the projector broke during the most climatic scare. Like minutes left of the movie.
Reactions
rip
Without seeing the ending, I‚Äôm unsure how I feel about it. If it could stick the landing, it was a decent horror movie with a few interesting themes. Otherwise it was fun but lacked the edge I thought it would have. Honestly I thought it was going to be much gorier and scarier than it ended up being.
I spent most of the movie thinking about how contemporary movies that are period pieces in the actually take place during lol
Damn I‚Äôm sorry about the projector situation, that sucks. Yeah I feel this‚Äîwith X & licorice pizza I spent a lot of time thinking about whether the storylines would hold up as well without nostalgia in the equation. I was definitely entertained watching it but it did feel like something I had seen before, even with its own self awareness of how tropey the plot was (really seemed like a boogie nights x Texas chainsaw massacre mashup.) idk I did like it but it did really make me think about how few horror movies & movies in general take place in a contemporary landscape
Licorice pizza felt like
Distracted by the fact it was so
yeah fr, was talking to someone older about this and they were like ‚Äúwell wasn‚Äôt paul Thomas Anderson growing up in the which made me sort of get that choice, but nostalgia fishing feels like such an easy tactic that I‚Äôm not totally sold on that defense

except that the culture from the past is part of what makes your culture now, so a good idea to be familiar with perspectives that were experienced it first hand. and you wouldn't want to pigeonhole yourself as a mere cog in  marketing nomenclature, would you?
that said i thought the movie was somewhat over indulgent and i just couldn't get myself to care for it, because it was too insular. and as a teenager i did not experience anything remotely alike to what those ppl were doing.

Re: McCabe and mrs Miller - it‚Äôs one of those rare works where the period set was being constructed during filming, and was also tied into the narrative of a developing town on the frontier
The set builders are in period garb with period tools building in the background
Quite the production
Is that the one with the Leonard cohen soundtraxk
you have to sell part of your soul and make drastic compromises in your vision to get funding to produce something like that today
I doubt it would ever get made
it's so gorgeous and sad.  tht period in general was somewhat golden for cinema. outside of  the us you have nic roeg on fire...
The were definitely a landmark in large cinematic visions with aesthetic and narrative indulgences we rarely get today in the mainstream. Anyone with that impetus now is relegated to lower budgets usually and that obviously changes the film
Indeed!
one of my fav narratives on american failure is about how all of that came to implode. this book is a great, if nerdy, read:

I guess it brushes shoulders with ‚Äúindie sleaze‚Äù but it definitely felt more trust fund hipster gentrifier sleaze, and successful at that from what I recall. Only saw it once in If anyone is wondering it‚Äôs *not* a Tim&Eric film, Heidecker just stars.  Very dark film overall ‚Äî as someone who lived in nyc during this time and experienced a number of scenes I think it was articulating something that probably stung too many at the time it was made
Is it supposed to be a critical assessment of the remnants of that culture or is it supposed to be a retrospective criticism of the culture as a whole?
Critical assessment of remnants
Reactions
üëç
And it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôd call the entire hipster scene - it‚Äôs the wealthy contingent within, the north Williamsburg first wave condo dwellers (of that time)
Within the scene many were opposed to the displays of wealth as a somewhat misguided signifier of inauthenticity, (remnants of misdirected notions of ‚Äòselling out‚Äô back when that term was on life support before people stopped caring). it took a few more years for the inter-generational wealthy to come out as rich. In some ways the film anticipates this and is present in the detached sociopathic frictions that arise from Heidecker‚Äôs carelessness in traversing both nyc and it‚Äôs people

i‚Äôm thinking abt this film and some others shown in this series (ex. videodrome, hackers) (also titane comes up for some reason) as narratives which explore contemp anxiety abt technology‚Äôs relationship to the human, big thoughts hours
and like how this anxiety is always connected to the body, and to social reproduction (so to gender and sexuality) - we see this here, definitely in the other films i mention like titane (if in a different way)
Reactions
heart
I bet you this server has some connection to the director
I totally agree with that grouping of movies. I like to think of them as  oblique viewings of bodies in space. The relationship of technology is interwoven, but they all share a disassociation with the body. This lets these movies really negotiate some of the core human issues with identity, but I love how distinctly queer there viewpoints are. I don‚Äôt consider Cronenberg or even Titane to be definitely trans movie, but they give great views into what it means to truly negotiate with your body.

Cronenbergs films have  always engaged with psychology and neurosis, and with his films he‚Äôs gone all in. Like he even made a movie about Freud and jung lmao. Anyone read his novel, Consumed?
Reactions
heart
Cronenberg kind of does what jarmusch does where he uses genre constraints to explore his larger thematic project
Maps to the Stars was amazing imo
i jsut watched memories of murder and it might be bong joon ho's best movie
Reactions
üëç
imo at least
its so damn good
watching mr. and mrs. smith now, also a perfect movie
A history of violence has a better premise, but eastern promises is just so much tighter imo
I personally just like stuff which maintains a veneer of realism that can then be broken in uncanny ways. I think EP does that exceptionally well. Really well plotted too, very suspenseful
Idk I was kind of going through a little Steven knight phase when I watched it
This guys crazy he did who wants to be a millionaire and peaky blinders but he also wrote EP, locke (which takes place entirely inside of a car), and Serenity which I think everyone in this discord should watch

Possessor was interesting. Definitely thought provoking but it hasn‚Äôt stuck with me too much as time has gone on. Good but I honestly don‚Äôt remember much of it by this point

idk. i watched the behind the scenes and seems to be a lot abt the women too. some pretty strong ones in the cast.

For sure.  first time I saw Anya Taylor joy on screen was the witch. Cool to see him work with her again. Loved the Witch but  never got around to watching lighthouse tho. feel like I missed the boat on that one and now whenever it comes up in my queue I always convince myself that I'm not in the right mood to watch it. is the hype real? Northman came on my radar pretty late. First time I saw the trailer was in theatres when I saw everything everywhere all at once a week or so ago. I had a marvel fanboy moment in the theatre during the clip of Skarsgard catching the spear and throwing it back lol.

Very good
Love cronenberg but the book is superior to the film in my humble subjective opinion
very good book, probably the strongest of the ballard novels ive read
maybe its because i heard so much about crash before watching it but outside of the premise and some costumes the movie wasn't anything to write home about
(to be clear the premise _is_ something to write home about)
If you didn't like Crash, try Sonic the Hedgehog Another high-speed *sensual af* thriller by Cronenberg . Have heard very good things about it...

Not enjoying "I'm Thinking Of Ending Things"

that movie is a nightmare
It's a thinly veiled commentary on aging and isolation posturing as an affecting examination of the processes inherent to decay
It's unnerving in a way that doesn't lend itself to pleasurable watching
ugh, I feel you on this. it is solipsistic drivel at its core. never been a fan of Kaufman though ‚Äì I file most of his films under 'sad immovable objects' I don't want living rent free in my mind.
Kaufman is low key gay
I didn‚Äôt like that movie that much

bit of a weird request: I watched Scanners last night (not my favourite Cronenberg but some interesting stuff to chew re: multiple personalities, pharmaceutical vs. practice-based methods to control body and mind). There's a scene where a character holds flames in each of his upturned palms. I could swear that I've seen a Vitruvian Man style drawing/icon/symbol of a t-posed man, potentially headless, with flames in his upturned palms, but I cannot find evidence of it on the internet. Has anyone come across this symbol before?

also the context of contemplative spirituality is in the interior of the individual  and maybe sometimes the interior of a small collective. when that comes up against structures of society (esp ours) in the form of material systems things can get a little wacky lol‚Ä¶.

Remind me at the end of the week. I‚Äôve quite a few films to catch in theaters this week üçø üé• üé≠
Did you guys find the acting  and writing in crimes of the future to be worse than a lot of his other stuff or just like, hyper stylized ? I‚Äôve only seen like two of his others so I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs kinda part of his thing or not
Cus I thought it was very purposeful but everyone else I saw it with thought it was just bad and me giving him too much self aware credit
didn't really resonate any different from his other movies to me. but also didn't think it was bad acting and the writing was meant to be somewhat funny.
saw dead ringers yesterday
Jeremy Irons killed that
Reactions
HELL YEA HE DID
my fav cronenberg
I enjoyed how stilted and weird k stew was
It was kinda hot
I loved the acting as well, especially Kristen Stewart‚Äôs performance, but I also felt like the writing wasn‚Äôt his best. The entire movie felt like exposition and right when the movie was picking up for me, it endedüôÅ
i was very down for the exposition
there's definitely some pretty stilted acting in it. k stew's performance is kind of bizarre, the repair people come off weird in every scene there in
and ive seen one of those actors before in things and she's a good actor lol
I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but if you‚Äôve seen Crash then.. just know there‚Äôs a third way for acting that is neither good nor bad just‚Äî- very Unusual
Love how in crash the actors are like weird props with desires rather than realistic people
Reactions
based
yeah i mean crony isnt really going for naturalistic
Ya
i agree the repair people's acting was off, seemed forced, kinda ruined those scenes a bit
I enjoyed it overall, but did anyone notice how the film quality at times was like so high it felt like you were on set, and the illusion of the film disappeared? That was the other thing that ruined some scenes for me. I don't know that much about film post-production...how do you fix that type of thing reduce the frame rate or add noise or was it just bad lighting?
Reactions

I don't watch tv that much but i noticed the same thing on some BBC tv series where the film quality was similarly bad...transparent

heart real
I have a lot to ponder, but I am here to say Crimes of the Future is a brilliant, prescient film.  Anyone who read xenofeminism should check it out.
Will see it a couple more times before I expand on my thoughts.  It dovetails nicely as a continuation of of the narrative and questions posed in Videodrome -> eXistenZ -> Cosmopolis -> Crimes of the Future.
Reactions
Incredibly juicy.  I haven‚Äôt left a film invigorated like this in some time
You‚Äôll have to elaborate as to why you believe that because I found the film to be extremely underwhelming and occasionally lacking in conviction and vision. This is not to say that it‚Äôs a bad film, it just didn‚Äôt strike me in the manner which I‚Äôd hoped it to
It‚Äôs so prescient my friend
As videodrome was
It‚Äôs the final nail in the simulacra coffin he started to build in videodrome
I understand the prescience and I found its awareness to occasionally be deeply unsettling, I just wish that the execution was as satisfying as Videodrome‚Äôs
Oh times change
He was a young man when he made that film
He didn‚Äôt even have the ending written until days before production completed
I think a younger person could have made this film and it would have just been boring overt repetitive anti-capitalist drivel hammering us in the head
Anyways I‚Äôm off for drinks to discuss, I‚Äôll circle back when I‚Äôve had some time to think
Reactions
üëç
Idk if any of his films are truly satisfying imo
I don‚Äôt mean to extend the conversation any longer than it‚Äôs gone on but I‚Äôd agree, I‚Äôm happy that a young person didn‚Äôt produce the film and I‚Äôve significant doubts as to whether they‚Äôd even be capable of doing so
Guys it‚Äôs not really about being satisfied - it‚Äôs art
Marvel movies satisfy - they entertain
Cronenberg pushes themes that are deeply personal that happen to be concerned with the near future of humankind
Reactions
Butter my ass and call me a funko pop
Reactions
üëÜ
I guess I‚Äôm a marvel boy
But I find his movies to have very dope premises that I always want him to expand upon
I think part of my dissatisfaction was that I dragged my ex and her friend to see it with me and they left disappointed
So that‚Äôs completely irrelevant to the actual thematic content of the film
Lol
They expand in your life
The expansion is here, now
That‚Äôs the idea
He opens the door
I got shitfaced watching it and can‚Äôt really recall the second half
Absolutely
What did that guy say in the movie?
‚ÄúI am a mechanic who builds doors and windows into the future‚Äù
Reactions
I think I just have world of Warcraft brain damage where I want like a whole worldbuilding lore thing to go with
We already live in the worlds he expresses - you are participating in the world building now
Reactions
What about this world had made humans resistant to pain? What material conditions exist that have people eating plastic and growing new parts? What happened
It‚Äôs implied that it‚Äôs humanity evolving
All of it is evolution
And the fear is that evolution is chaos, when it‚Äôs simply a system of order that we don‚Äôt understand, let alone control
It‚Äôs all there
Nothing is missing
I found the scenes featuring performance art to be both the most unsettling and most fascinating aspects of the film
I greatly appreciated those
Lots of excellent societal critique there
It‚Äôs better that it‚Äôs implied and the viewer imagines those pieces - it‚Äôs the subjective spaces that make films like this good. It‚Äôs an exploration of an idea, not a world
Of a NOW that we are within
And one  way to extrapolate meaning from  now is to set it in another time, another place - the distance allows for better analysis
Reactions
real
Yeah the art world critique was just bonus surface level humor
Reactions
üëÜ
I guess I just am more into explorations of world a la high fantasy shit
Sounds like you appreciate literalism
Now I‚Äôm not knocking the movie I enjoy cronenberg
No stones left unturned
Yeah
That‚Äôs cool
Derek‚Äôs making want to re-watch the film just so that I can attempt to study it in greater detail, especially the dialogue
I think I need to rewatch it clearheaded
I watched scanners last week again and really appreciated that the ending felt like a whole world was introduced
A new playing field
A whole other movie was about to start
I love that
That‚Äôs how I felt about existenz and the brood and I wanted moooooooore
Reactions
üëÜ
And then the movie ends.
Existenz literally implies that they never left the simulation
That they are lost within it
The escape is not possible nor should it be desirable
The simulacara is relative
Yeah I guess that‚Äôs one thing I really enjoy about him cus he‚Äôs also able to do it without creating this cliff hanger affect, it‚Äôs like just showing us that these characters exist in their universe beyond the scope of the movie
So yeah it ends and suddenly there‚Äôs more movie there
And the brood is an early imperfect film so ya know it‚Äôs a solid early feature for what it is
Same with shivers
Cronenberg is clearly working something out with his films because they boil down to the same themes explored in different spaces
Reminds me a lot of Hesse in that sense
The brood has this underlying theme of cults and new age self help and the dangers of that but it‚Äôs always just kinda there and never expanded upon and I want him to go in!!! He never does tho
Life rarely does
Sometimes you just enter into an entire prefabricated world that you never get the gist of
No mastery
Yeah but it‚Äôs a movie where a director has control over everything fabricated and made and shown in a world
Actually the brood was a documentary
That‚Äôs why I love loving here - I enter into entire universes that should not exist but almost always have and will
They aren‚Äôt for me to know unless I want to dedicate my life to them
But I can‚Äôt, so all I have are my impressions of moving through those universes during a fixed moment in space time
I get where you‚Äôre coming from here and I think I just disagree bc I play dnd and want to know everything about everything
Reactions
real
In the lore/worldbuilding kind of way
Does he? Or is he using mythopoetic narratives to express something that was already happening in the real world at that time
*The Odyssey* isn‚Äôt a documentary, however the mythic aspects are a better way to experience the true perceptions of a time in order to digest a more wholistic  paradigm than simply reading facts and assumptions of facts in a dry PHD dissertation
Cronenberg should write a ttrpg that takes place in his cinematic universe then ill be happy ig
You can write it
Others have I think
Do you think that Cronenberg aims to convey caution or hesitance to his audience regarding the societal developments he‚Äôs examining or is he merely conveying their continued development through his work? Do you think his work has an overt moral character or is he content to be a bystander whose more so interested in examining a variety of possible ramifications that might arise from the continuation of such developments?
He conveys what is
Sorry, long question, but it‚Äôs worth considering
He shows both the caution and those that through themselves in
‚ÄúI create windows and doors into the future‚Ä¶ politics come later‚Äù
That is very, very true of today
Of all time
I couldn‚Äôt agree more
He‚Äôs a conduit
He lays it out
You can be the judge
Could you rephrase this
Simpler
I‚Äôm retarded
Tattooing the organs is clearly about capital
About pulling king tut‚Äôs tomb out of a pyramid burial chamber and throwing it into a museum. About stripping if of its meaning that we can never truly understand, because we do not have the proper paradigms of lived experience of that period.
Throwing it into the white box museum strips it of its original meaning. The amorphous shape of capitalism absorbs the unknown into its lexicon, only to alphabetize and catalogue it, and then become a rigid box yet again, once the difference is resolved
Something about the tat organs and the organ beareau reminded me of all the abortion legislation that‚Äôs going on now
Hence the vulgarity in seeing American traditional tattoos always already on the organs of something that was supposed to be new, and paradigm shattering
Instead the vulgarity of the system has already destroyed the difference, the new paradigm, as the system conspires to maintain itself
Reactions
üëÜ
It‚Äôs all so clear to me, I feel uniquely primed to appreciate this film
Ballard and Cronenberg were huge parts of my youth and subsequent development
I thought a significant amount about how we‚Äôve resorted to the modification of our appearance (forced aesthetic evolution of our bodies) as a means of attempting to re-assert some degree of autonomy or idiosyncratic character, despite Capitalism‚Äôs homogenizing tendencies
Exactly
There are already fetish clubs that perform surgeries in a similar fashion
It is a thing already
And this theme of where to take the transgressive behaviors has been a question for centuries
What happens when violence to an other is no longer enough?
What happens when Sex and drugs become meaningless to the addict?
Reactions
What is next within a system comprised of desiring machines?  Of people that see themselves as living desires?
Reactions
üëÜ
I need to talk to Cronenberg before he dies
Get him on pm
I will ask around
We‚Äôre probably link removed from each other
This kind of thinking is endlessly fascinating for me
That‚Äôs why I found the scenes featuring dissection and mutilation so hard to stomach - I had to avert my eyes numerous times because I felt as if I grasped the enormity of the repercussions of such actions
Damn I ate a bag of popcorn

Maybe I‚Äôve just read and watched way too much extreme and atypical libidinal stuff
It was just an aesthetic for me
An archetypal language of fleshy symbols that harkens back to his earlier films
I was thinking that the implants in his partners head reminded me of Hecate. A representation of the unconscious desire to adapt literally bursting through (her skull) into consciousness.
Attachments

joy_pain
It‚Äôs not as if I hadn‚Äôt been exposed to similar content, it was just more so that the various acts performed in the film seemed to have been normalized to a degree I found intolerable
I really don‚Äôt like the idea of transcending humanity‚Äôs seemingly innate limitations
I find myself sympathizing with Nietzsche in that regard
Remember - it‚Äôs about the survival of those who adapt, not those that are fit.  Darwin never said the latter
Eat the damn trash can
Reactions
real
Humanity is and is not choosing
Humanity is adapting to its environment
It‚Äôs implied that it‚Äôs a willful adaptation on an unconscious level
But more consciously we still fight it because of an actual unnatural conception of humanity that we are clinging too and foolishly mistaking as natural.  Do we submit to a force greater than us?  Do we fight it?
You always already have been and always will
It was mostly digital
It‚Äôs hard to reconcile the two
Right
That‚Äôs why we die
Reactions
real
Because we can‚Äôt
I‚Äôve fully accepted the trashcan
And another generation can
You literally don‚Äôt have to - just die
I know I‚Äôm infertile I can just sense it
Cronenberg often has some shadowy corporate or state agency attempting to control or suppress narratives of progress
Reactions
Another classic and solid theme of his
Hell viggo played the same guy in eastern promises
I see a lot of cronenberg‚Äôs career coming together here
And I expect his next film to be a climax of sorts
For whatever reason, this conversation has made me slightly more comfortable with my current existence and its intrinsic futility than I did maybe even as recently as minutes ago
Reactions

Loved the sub plot of bureaucratic nobodies horseshoeing themselves into fetishizing the thing they are paid to keep in line
Reactions
They were a welcome addition
Yeah and the light hearted behavior around the murdering
Very Peter Greenaway in that respect
Skipping down the stairs after drilling some guy in the head
And of course
Viggo as an extension of his art is literally helping a CIA like agency keep others in line
Sounds a lot like AbEx
He hates his body so much that he literally calls the FEDs on anyone who enjoys their body lmao
All of which is apart of his praxis

The new ‚Äúfilmmaker mode‚Äù setting is also being championed by Martin Scorsese, Patty Jenkins, Ryan Coogler, and more.
I've said this other places but if existenz shows us what media does to the body, crimes of the future shows us what the body becomes _after_ media.
There are (almost) no screens or billboards or books in this world, and they certainly aren't functionally equivalent to how they're used now: to activate our pleasure centers into _consuming_ more..
The darkest part for me was this: all of these  systems of domination & control that exist now, exist in crimes of the world future. The difference being that in this future cronenberg envisions, the mediating effect of visual media is no longer needed because these systems of control have been fully _internalized_. Even capitals tendency to accelerate has wormed its way into our bodies through the production of new organs. (Also interesting to note there are no modern forms of transport, save a few beached container ships in the background of a few scenes)

Hi - new to the chat. I really appreciate your analysis. Love the Xenofeminism connection as a Feminist Science and Tech Studies researcher. My analytical faculties were unfortunately subdued during my viewing in theaters - after a vasovagal response took over (the facial cutting performance got me).

I had to sit outside the theater blinded by dizziness and nausea, repeating to myself ‚Äúplease stay here, please stay here.‚Äù I stumbled into the AMC bathroom and collapsed on the ground after yelling ‚Äúhelp!‚Äù No one came. I vomited, felt a lot better, and returned to my seat to finish the movie. I went to see the film alone and was the only person in the theater during a matinee. Word to the wise, maybe this movie and it‚Äôs important social critiques are better understood via laptop.

Anyone have thoughts on demonlover? Saw it for the first time last night, I think it has some really interesting ideas, but basically fails on a narrative and character level. It also looks terrible, but sometimes in a cool way.
i watched it a couple months ago and i remember saying to someone "this movie looks like a like not a playstation game, just the itself
Reactions
üíØ
also yeah i feel about the same. it was interesting and i liked the vibe but i'm not sure if i'd rewatch it
if i had to frame what the movie was saying it would be like: whether physically (Karen) or metaphorically (Elise), capital will find a way to screw you no matter what, and in rare cases it will end up being both (in the case of Diane)
That seems about right. I also think there are a few interesting themes: desensitization via digital content, the way globalized capitalism distributes agency for cruelty and violence. It reminded me of in that you‚Äôre witnessing terrible things and slowly connecting them to mostly banal actions taken across the world.
Reactions
nahfr
one of my fav cult movies. i've rewatched it a few times since i saw it upon its release.but that is the problem with any movie addressing technology: it dates fast. think of how old this movie is.
i love the super look. it aligns with what was going on visually then with many directors shooting features digitally. my fav. ones are by soderbherg and  figgis.

When Isle of Dogs first premiered I watched it at a very old cinema palace and I was absurdly high on mushrooms for the duration of the movie and at one point convinced myself that it was a dramatic/fictional retelling of a true story and I ended up vomiting after the movie ended due to the relief that I did not in fact exist in the same universe as‚Ä¶ whatever the fuck message that film was trying to convey.
Animation dept. was top tier tho ngl
I‚Äôd say it was cast well, disappointed with the casting for Lady Jessica and Gaius Helen Mohiam

Imagine being a group of anthropologists and scientists traveling to witness another culture‚Äôs renaissance ‚Ä¶ only to experience a perpetual dark age ‚Ä¶
@FlipKostic I have to ask what made you think of this?  I was going to suggest it as another slow feature akin to Tarkovsky, with themes closer to the cell‚Äôs interests.
@Umberto Ecco I‚Äôve definitely mentioned this to you in passing a few times. You should tune if you have the time tonight.

Anyone else noticing a recent uptick of Hollywood blockbusters that fundamentally obscure the CIA‚Äôs various historical MKULTRA programs?  Given that events like the CIA‚Äôs orchestration of Jonestown are now popular Twitter conspiracy fodder, the timing of this movie is interesting.  Tarantino‚Äôs last film is another example; it overshadowed Tom O‚ÄôNeil‚Äôs *Chaos* book as it was making waves in firmly connecting Manson to the CIA.

Well the CIA‚Äôs Hollywood department is quite active and public, however I‚Äôm getting at this trend of biopics that ostensibly place themselves as the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù account, or are so phantasmagorical that their simplistic fiction is desired more than any real comprehension of historical events whose hidden mechanisms reach into the present.  There are definitely hype cycles to these things and figures like this will continue to be resurrected with each generation.  I just know the reality of the Jonestown programming camp is trending in our circles, making a larger impact than it historically has when discussed.  The spectacle of these biopics seems to intensify, as if in response.

This lighting choice ouch
Wasted on the actors
they did a lot with mil tbh

I think it could be a little better if you had less high paid actors - butler might have commanded a sizable portion of the budget, unless he went for box office sales percentage
yeah i was thinking that about the music lmao

all time favs
havent seen it since high school
Absolutely, certainly should be screened here. I think Stalker would be a great Tarkovsky starting point for the cell. The dilemma posed by the room at the center of the zone concerns the realization of the unconscious desires of the three characters whose representative archetypes I feel are quite relevent here and to the modern day. The exploration of Aristotelian unity is relevant as well (location, action, and time).

At one point, there was talk of doing a discord livestream walkthrough of Andrei Rublev. Sort of a ‚ÄúTarkovsky for people who don‚Äôt think they can watch Tarkovsky‚Äù.

I watched the new james bond my take away was
the opening sequence where a bunch of guns spiral in a double helix and then shoot bullets to create a stream which connects each gun node to the other side of the helix was incredible and i'd like to recreate it for an artwork
I would like to be hired to make the opening sequence for a bond movie but realize that they are basically committing suicide with the franchise after this film
Ana de Armas is beautiful and I love her, my new celebrity crush
The movie was like an hour too long and pretty boring
it gets bags of popcorn and a soda pop from me because i enjoyed some of it if you let yourself just take in the bond formula, but it drags on long enough that you get tired of it

@Orfhtiff is there a good IRA movie we could watch?
Hunger is good, Wind that Shakes the Barley is good
Reactions
Wind that shakes the Barley focusing on the sort of beginnings of the formation of the organised IRA, and Hunger is much more recent, and about my mother‚Äôs famous neighbour lol
In the name of the father is also great, about innocent men wrongly imprisoned under the terrorism act of Britain, less of a focus on the IRA and more of a focus on the corruption of the British government
There‚Äôs also quite a lot on The Troubles in general
ah yes the least photogenic political martyr of all time, mr sands
Hahaha my mum said he was hot!!!!
Wind that shakes the barley is a fuckin banger
Great illustration of why you shouldn‚Äôt interrupt a couple dudes playing hurling
TRIVIA that was actually not hurling that they‚Äôre playing in the opening scene
Oh fuck really? Enlighten me
Michael collins is a good movie and it does accurately depict how much of an asshole my namesake was
Snape as Dev, inspired casting
I‚Äôll ask my da can‚Äôt remember the name
Yeah no offence but not the best name in the book in that sense, but I really do like the name Eamon
I didn‚Äôt watch the micky Collins one, Maeve is also a pretty good one too
Yeah likewise, thanks to my grandma

Aye you‚Äôre lucky you made that wee edit Eamon

P entertaining thriller (kind of reminds me of come and see actually) and it gets into some of the more covert politics of the conflict
Love wind that shakes the barley and hunger too though

Music by van Morrison lol. Yeah that looks awful

but idk whats up with the matrix, this shit happens a lot. it reminds me of undergrad crit where someone makes a work that is relatively bad formally for instance but is interesting concept, and they get hyped  by classmates around the concept and think that the cool thing is the formal
and they just make more bad formal work afterwards
like the film makers/vfx house didn't understand what we liked about the look of the original matrix movies
and they thought that the robot war in zion was what we were actually into

Mainstream caters to the lowest common denominator and the most sellable tropes. It always looks like shit, appreciate whatever you can from it or just look elsewhere know what I mean?  There are so many great pieces of historical media that speak better to now, than most stuff that gets pushed to the surface today.  Anything new that does encapsulate some element of the zeitgeist today often doesn‚Äôt have the budget or connections to be impactful or visible. I know that all sounds obvious but it is what it is
I was up last night watching this Abel Ferrara executive produced comedy about an NYC techno store going under in The owner Keith is a down and out trance DJ who is struggling to cope with the changing cultural climate, so he organizes a rave in a final effort to save the store. Felt incredibly relevant to today. Low budget but doesn‚Äôt look like shit, its raw unpolished aesthetic lends to the authenticity of the story.

People have so much energy to critique, to digest lore, and to write new stories to fill plot holes of mediocre entertainment.
The ability to digest is always present and the desire for new media, for new narratives; it‚Äôs at the core of humanity.

I watched ‚ÄòThree Days of the Condor‚Äô after, to sort of balance the viewing.  Both films are critical of covert CIA activities during the same era, although serving entirely different agendas.  Condor is a Hollywood produced film about a bookish analyst whose team has been suddenly murdered, presumably by his own colleagues or something more covert, so he‚Äôs been framed for the murders.  Definitely more of a dad flick but I got a kick out of how the ‚Äòmild mannered analyst‚Äô described his job:

||like every sequel/reboot/revival is a pull between what fans expect and what the creator wants, and the movie was very clear about "i don't want to make this fucking movie and you probably don't want me too either." By putting that issue on the main character everyone likes, it allowed for the movie to be a lot more human about the whoring out of a beloved film for a cinematic universe. All that said, the action stuff is bad and it's attempt to be a proper sequel on top of trolling everyone didn't really work. Still, it was novel and interesting||

Our culture is glitching, looping, stuck in some long, static interregnum. So is ‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections.‚Äù
> Especially because the original Matrix, as imagined by sororal duo Lilly and Lana Wachowski, felt genuinely inventive. It blended Terminator-styled dystopian sci-fi with Hong Kong wire-fu action and state-of-the-art special effects, all draped in the industrial liveries of a turn-of-the-millennium goth club. It may not have been wholly new. But it was thrilling remix. It spoke to the ennui of America at the ‚Äúend of history.‚Äù It captured the soul-deadening, Dilbert-esque daily doldrums explored in films like Fight Club and Office Space. It also played straight to the anxiety around and the mounting cultural panic that home computers and toaster ovens might break down or turn against their owners. The Matrix felt like it was speaking to its time. Now, movies seem to chatter only among themselves.

The director quote about using the film as a step out of depression after the death of their parents, and having to be haggled by the cast to finish shooting during COVID signaled to me that it in aggregate, it was probably more fun to make than it would be to watch (pass)

hey probs been asked a times but does anyone know where you can watch Arguing The World for free?
Do you guys think the shot-by-shot stuff at the start intentionally looks worse then the original (would sort of make sense in the context of the story) or does it just show the decline in film making standards from the
Hard to say, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intentional. That gives the director too much credit.  It was more disappointing than anything else.  Even if we had to keep the story there are so many better ways to shoot it. I assume wachowski‚Äôs hands were partly tied to mediocre concepts. If not, then shame on them.

i had a lot of fun w/ them playing with the meta stuff
i am fully a wachowski apologist and big fan of the contemporary novelist david mitchell tho
lana david and this other guy wrote matrix
I feel you. I usually can appreciate what they do. I just think there could have been an actual message relevant to today in there this isn‚Äôt a grudge beating critique on the state of the industry
um the message is that you are NOT crazy if you have revelations of a higher order world, in fact your blue framed glasses psychiatrist is a part of the plot
and your chewable blue tablets only keep you down
Audio is very shoddy for me
Only getting the highest registers
Oh I think it's just coming from Josh's audio
I think I figured it out on my end
|| Why on earth was there a massive Twitter campaign illustrating the matrix series as a trans allegory (as a marketing tool) only to sorta drop that message?  It‚Äôs very convoluted. I mean towards the end neo can‚Äôt Fly, trinity can, and then at the very end somehow they both can fly?   I don‚Äôt understand how that ties into the original metaphor unless they represent both sides of the gender binary living in unity.  What‚Äôs beyond the binary truly is non-dualism;  meaning in this case a sense of harmony and unity that penetrates biological gender.  At least that‚Äôs the impression I‚Äôve gotten from reading the Wachowski‚Äôs interviews across the years. I couldn‚Äôt find that at all in the film.  Also, I don‚Äôt think the entire field of therapy should be written off.  I‚Äôm getting tired of that meme.
Also I almost KMS when White Rabbit started to play. The first film was very in your face with the metaphors but at least not that bad. If we‚Äôre leaning on previously established metaphors, it seems insane but perhaps the obviousness was just a massive fuck you to executive producers asking for the metaphors to be clearer. ||
That being said David I respect your POV and look forward to you changing my own. I haven‚Äôt given the film much thought beyond my initial reactions.
I hated it
I thought it was more that the matrix wasn't an allegory it's actually a love story
But it was just so meta in a soy way and with lots of wedon style dialogue
Idk how you guys can acknowledge the movie clearly is a self-own about its own existence and then critique it for not continuing specific allegories from past movies. Wachowski seems clear that they resent the idea anyone would prescribe to the creator of the story what it‚Äôs really about. There‚Äôs a reason they had no desire to return to the franchise after Revelations and it‚Äôs because they had no interest in that whole process.
Reactions
I hear you but that‚Äôs not my POV. I thought that the creators intentionally brought the trans metaphor to light during the promotional press junket, as a narrative thread to tie all four films together. I was commenting that I didn‚Äôt see that in the film despite how often it was discussed by the cast and creator, after David mentioned his understanding of the higher level metaphor.  There where a lot of hands involved in the final edit so it is what it is.  Anyways I rate the film bag of popcorn and four middle fingers
oh i didnt consume any promotional stuff
it seemed like the movie specifically derided the idea it was a trans metaphor
Yeah, I know. Odd given the insistence that the original series was firmly a trans allegory
i tend to subscribe to the view they made a trans metaphor but didn't really intend to
Yeah totally. Perhaps it was less conscious at the time, as during the first film neither of the creators had transitioned.  Lana pretty much confirms that here, but in other interviews goes harder in it always being their intention.

Re: matrix I'm curious about the Lily/ Lana working partnership since Resurrections is Lana only. That seems to suggest that Lana was more concept+ actor oriented and Lily did more of the heavy lifting when it came to the action side- anyone know if there's any truth to that?
I've never researched them too much despite being a massive fan of the original. Idk if they talk much about their working partnership, duos tend to be cagey about that for some reason

Taxi Driver is on Netflix and this is my first time seeing it as adult
Absolutely surreal how Scorsese made a fantasy for modern day /fit/ redpillers years ago
Although maybe that culture is like that because of taxi driver? Not sure if it was influential or prophetic
Last Life in the Universe and Caf Lumire come to mind.  seconding Rebels of the Neon God too

Un Chien Andalou is the one everyone has seen/referenced, so I'd start there

It came out with the brutal and violent wave of films right after the viet nam war officially ended. Interesting to consider it was the last war that america really televised the deceased returning from war in coffins along with publishing violent imagery from the war.  Propaganda has certainly changed in response to the anti-war movement that was polarized by said imagery.  It‚Äôs also a response to the socio economic climate of Manhattan / Times Square of the time
New York was starting to collapse
Consider films like Dirty Harry in this vein along with most of Sam peckinpah‚Äôs oeuvre
Peckinpah is very interesting in that he theorized that extremely violent movies would prove to be a catharsis for the wounded ego, broken image and internal conflict of post viet nam war era america.  (He basically invented slow motion action sequences.)  sadly towards the end of this life he concluded his career was a failure in that he simply helped feed and expand the appetite for violence in American cinema.  I think some of his films would probably really resonate with the cell.

that's funny because i'm told that's easily the weakest of the three, but still good apparently
There‚Äôs really something to his films in which he would cast older actors known for Embodying an ideal type of masculinity in a previous era. He‚Äôd place them in a Fin de sicle environment in which their old values would be confronted by the ideals of a new time.  The Wild Bunch exemplifies this narrative to a dispiriting yet poignant degree.
Reactions
At least that‚Äôs what I see in some of his best work.  Perhaps this is the through line to other violent films of the time like Taxi Driver.
i've heard the same thing which makes me excited to watch his other films
i found it refreshing to see a  well done genre film that didn't attempt to deconstruct any tropes
yeah definitely
though I'd say Unforgiven probably my favorite western
The climax of that film is wild.

Death Wish helped kick off this trend / tendency too; speaking to a post-counterculture fears / frustration - not just around urban decline / drug derangement but the paranoia inspired by the Zodiac Killer, Manson, etc.  Interesting though it feels like Death Wish's dissonant soundtrack really gives a sense of 'wrongness' to the protagonist's embrace of violence, it's a decidedly dark turn.  But in addition to dark / gritty / nihilistic dramas it basically started the violent action movie trend, which quickly shed the dark / paranoid atmospherics

For sure, there‚Äôs a handful of films from that era tied to the new wave of extreme violence that really exemplified the concept

seems like you're interested in the euro art house canon. I'd add dardenne brothers & thomas vinterberg - the celebration as picks. I think you'd have fun with maoist era Godard, before he goes full video essay.
The majority of the films that I've watched or intend to watch are of that tradition - I'm trying to diversify my own taste, but it's a challenge when I still haven't seen many of the most well-respected and acclaimed films within the Art House canon. On the topic of Godard, I've watched three of his films and left each feeling relatively unaffected and apathetic - it may just be his pacing, but I find it challenging to fully immerse myself within much of his work. While I did enjoy Masculin Feminin (It being most recent engagement with his work), I found myself distracted and unable to appreciate the dialogue and thematic content to the extent that I'd like.

I Was Nineteen (German: Ich war neunzehn) is a DEFA production that tells the story of a young German, Gregor Hecker (Jaecki Schwarz), who fled the Nazis with his parents to Moscow and now, in early returns to Germany as a lieutenant in the Red Army. The film strives to maintain an aura of authenticity and pay homage to history by interspl...

It‚Äôs really great and is also somehow kind of a hangout movie?
Jin Roh: the Wolf Brigade and Grave of Fireflies you‚Äôd probably like if you‚Äôre into dour euro art house stuff
This was one of the best films I‚Äôve seen recently. Really exciting style. Vernier borrows a lot from Claire Denis and Ulrich Seidl with the films narrative constructed from a disparate collage of vignettes, portraits, documentary-style footage. It‚Äôs about a murder that takes place within a corporate park‚Ä¶ let me know if you‚Äôd like a link https://boxd.it/jAOS

A huge reason as to why I‚Äôm fascinated by Tarkovsky‚Äôs films is largely in part in which his films compare and reflect the broader time frame he was creating his films in the USSR. It‚Äôs spiritual meditation on time, nature, and the individual are indicative of a nation and the morale of an entire society crippled by economic turmoil, policies losses on the world political stage, and a growing number of people losing faith in institutionalized religion. Tarkovsky‚Äôs films give me an interesting juxtaposition as to the current state of American culture and politics with a increasing divide between the two political parties
Reactions

Such a good film. Will never forget seeing the scene from your top screenshot for the first time. So unexpected and truly unnerving, but still felt utterly personal and intimate. Sometimes the films are so personal that they feel sealed up to Tarkovsky himself, but of course they can't help but mirror (pun intended) the cultural moment around him.
Have you seen last film The Sacrifice? Sort of a nuclear-fear reaction film, but it feels particularly relevant today the way he portrays the loss of meaning and return to spiritualism/magic in the face of a life-threatening event.
While we're on the thread of Russian cinema, anyone here seen the Dau series by Ilya Khrzhanovskiy? IMO One of the grandest experiments in modern cinema. The second half of Degeneration is particularly interesting, when the Russian neo-nazi Maxim Martsinkevich joins the Dau institute

Dau degeneration was horrifying. I‚Äôve been meaning to watch the rest of the series. A family member who lived in the eastern bloc said it does a good job of capturing the general vibe of living under a dictatorship
Yeah the back story on the former KGB officer conducting interrogations is wild too. From what I remember he was imprisoned for a long while in the Soviet Union for torture. So I get that it captures the paranoia of the eastern bloc.
The other films in the series are basically character studies - Nora Mother was a really intimate portrait. Same with Natasha, though it was equally horrifying as degeneration. The others kinda suck IMO

IMO It‚Äôs more about having to be a closeted Christian during a time when religion and faith are violently repressed.  Stalker is a Christian Allegory set in the heart of the ‚Äúevil empire.‚Äù
Critically acclaimed film at the time of its release that I feel has aged wonderfully and deserves the continued praise.  Great Brando era before his epic decline
Reactions
Tarkovsky was deeply affected by this having grown up with his poet father who had an immense love of Christ.  His father‚Äôs poetry became distilled into the Stalker‚Äôs monologues, mixed with various passages from the Bible that reference Christ.

üì∫ Found Footage Double Feature üîç
Transformers: The Premake by  Kevin B. Lee
YouTube videos are transformed into a critical investigation of the global big budget film industry, amateur video making, and the political economy of images.
Fraud by Dean Fleischer-Camp
A family's home movies document a desperate crime spree and the bid to outrun the consequences. Born from a colossal trove of innocuous uploads to YouTube, Fraud is an impressionistic meta-fiction thriller that reveals one family's struggle for the American Dream and the mutability of the stories we tell online. (This is one of my all time favorites)
Reactions
pepe_booba heart
When I watched this film recently, and in reference to these stills, I think about his concept of ‚Äúimprints in time‚Äù. That these images he created on film are from his childhood memories, so visceral and psychologically present in him, that the viewer also feels the memories are their own, or that they have very similar memories.

Deliverance is great. It has not one, but two iconic scenes

I was super fascinated with the movie‚Äôs relationship with nature
the land is rugged and unforgiving but also achievable, there is no spiteful supernatural earth mother that punishes them
Deliverance
yes
Added to my watch list
the crazy violence of nature is all by their invitation, they wanted one last lick of being ‚Äúrugged men‚Äù‚Äù before other people dammed up the river
I‚Äôd argue against this kinda
It wasn‚Äôt The Big Thing like it is now
But we see stuff like the cleaning up of lake eerie, the crying indian commercial , the clean air act all at the same time and before the movie came out
Environmental stuff is def a thing
yeah
I haven‚Äôt seen it though
Just the dueling banjo scene
Racking my brain for where I would‚Äôve seen that before

but i think its worth thinking about how, while environmental concerns were obv a thing in media, the tone/ultimate aim influences the actual content a lot

iron eyes cody as america's past and ability to see beauty, but it's not like he saw a duck choking on a plastic bag or anything, or a village getting flooded. he cried at that litter bc the litter was ugly, and thats why a lot of nature lover stuff from before like the felt kind of flippant and i guess the image of the tree hugger became an image of somebody w too much time on their hands. it was a cause to pick up bc you didn't have any more immediate problems. now, it's more of a straight up life or death thing

I watched in theaters
seeing that movie trailer a few months back made me feel a little crazy
Watching it in the theater was weird. It had some weird right wing moments.
huh that is weird
totally thought it was gonna be like way more lib for some reason
or at least play it a little less straight w that title??
There‚Äôs like a montage of him trying to pick up girls in Portland Oregon and when he says he‚Äôs a veteran they‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh so you have a white savior complex‚Äù
So it felt like it was really trying to win over the anti-woke audience.
It unfortunately was not very funny. And the dog and him never cuddle all that much.
I hope one of them had blue hair
Went to see liquorice pizza and a trailer for this paid beforehand, really made me feel like I was living in a simulation

the last movie i saw was parasite iirc
and then i saw licorice pizza and just had to piss the whole fucking time
Ok I‚Äôm gonna peep that trailer.
Going to the movies is ‚Äúthe end of the future‚Äù feeling now. Especially the content of the actual movies that come out.
it‚Äôs also just this like weird in between of home and public space since so many of us spent time watching movies during lockdown and now to be doing that in a kind of half open public space, when the world is like half open is just.. weird. end of future vibe ur speaking of maybe?
Reactions
yeah that perfectly articulates it. I feel like I‚Äôm so desensitized to dumb Marvel shit at this point but I‚Äôm still sort of puzzled by how films like Dog can exist. Ik there have always been box office flops but it really feels like there‚Äôs so much unwatchable content right now
l cannot imagine watching anything I saw commercials for aside from maybe as a free movie on a southwest flight
sry i didn‚Äôt mean to interrupt
oh no you‚Äôre good!
For sure
different interpretation than I had but feel that too üôÇ

It‚Äôs weird to hear strangers laughing when the only way I‚Äôve watched movies was alone or in small groups
Reactions
For the last few years
yeah at this point if I‚Äôm gonna go to the movies it‚Äôs for some kind of the communal experience
I feel like really leaning into that aspect of it would be interesting
ya theatres r peculiar cuz it always feel so communal even tho you don‚Äôt rly interact with the other viewers that much. it still feels distinctly different than watching something alone or with a small group even tho it‚Äôs just like ‚Äòstrangers‚Äô in the dark. makes me think of dance clubs as well.
Nah Cyrano looks fun Peter Dinklage rocks and I like the OG play

It was pretty to look at but story wise, it was very meandering
It was an interesting update to the character but also I‚Äôm entering a sort of anti-Hollywood phase in my film knowledge. American films don‚Äôt surprise me anymore
You'll get over that.
In the future all movies will be part of a cinematic universe. I have embraced this cynical future and I'm glad they're making more than just superhero movies. This was like a mystery thriller. The cabal is rediscovering genre.
That's why Matrix Resurrections was so good because they allowed anyone to make any movie in that cinematic universe because it's not "about" anything specific
Found myself enjoying Edge of Tomorrow far more than I initially expected I would

It looks cool and has a lot of cool stuff but Jesus Christ it is so long and boring
Yea I‚Äôve been hearing since it was announced that they were gonna continue the anti superhero movie trope that the joker kinda coined, but might‚Äôve been excepting at least a little bit of tension carried throughout that extends further than just a law and order vibe. Idk, I‚Äôll have to sit through it myself lol
Anti super hero movie being minimal action and more introspective character development etc

Bob lookin hella strange in this tbh
Didn‚Äôt need the last like mins but the rest was pog as fuck
I enjoyed it more than joker that‚Äôs for sure
i was straight up so bored for most of the movie, i nearly fell asleep
didn't care about any of the crime drama really
there were some really great moments but like half the movie was medium close up/close up shots of someone talking
idk maybe i am being too harsh but i really thought it was mediocre but the stylistic choices were very dialed in, some really cool world building and some god awful acting from the kravitz chick. really collin ferrel and the dude that played riddler autistically carried the cast
There was some terrible acting
Pattinson is overrated ngl
Dano shined hard tho
hate to say i agree

hes so sexy......
although i liked him in the lighthouse

Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the obvious sequel setup too

It felt like they meant to cut a lot of the ending but just didn‚Äôt. The whole last mins every scene felt like it was gonna end there but then didn‚Äôt
lmao for sure
i was ready to get up like times bc i was rly bored and thought it was over
they are fully going to make a fucking joker movie again lmfao
Shit looked expensive as hell they probably just didn‚Äôt wanna lose their investment

The fx were really good tho
Like how did they do a lot of that
ya some good vfx for sure, i like this batman the most of any. gritty emo batman that doesnt show face ever

the character not the movie

I thought Danos little vlog was cute
Was kinda rooting for him ngl
the fucking cheesy ass online radicalization plot
He‚Äôs just like me fr
some of the writing was so damn bad and i am unsure if that is just them being reverent to an old comic book and then it not translating to screen or what
Yea I was the only dude laughing at points cuz parts were like bruh seriously? You spent this much on this just to get some year old dweeb to pry this bit in?
lol
Also I don‚Äôt think anyone else caught the part where penguin was waddling. Disappointed in that crowd
i loved the riddler character and was very much on board with him until one line at the end where he || is mad at bruce wayne for being a cooler orphan than him ||

Also I hate to be that guy but it seemed like they went for a realism vibe at times but then completely abandoned it at others. Like bruh he has internal bleeding
Also I probably shouldn‚Äôt be spoiling lol sorry I don‚Äôt know how to work this fucking app lol

and just gets up
When he‚Äôs feet away from a ied and just gets up

Late showing on a weeknight tho I guess
my theatre was full of kids and their parents
running to pee times
because the movie went on times as long as the longest video they have watched in their short lives
Literally a of their whole life so far was spent confused at why Batman is doing that
i can't stress enough how stupid it is that that movie was so long. it felt so self indulgent
no more long movies im retarded

Yea my ass hurts lol
i was so mad that the car showed up in the preview. my favorite thing was when it jumped through the fire and i already saw it like every weekend for the past months in previews
i wouldve been fine with just the first scene of him on the motorcycle with nirvana playing and one shot of him with the heavy makeup
i will say the title card was GOATED

That would‚Äôve slapped way harder
Was a fan of the sound design and the score

didn't care for the dude they had play alfred
he looks like years older than robert pattinson
Yea also they left him in the dust hard
lmao dude got mogged
yaa :// the last alfred was too goated
That actor kills it in everything I forget his name
I did like the lack of stupid bat voice
i love the stupid bat voice
Also the catwoman romance arc felt unnecessary and stupid I thought they‚Äôd throw a curve ball and skip that this time
they honestly did not need the catwoman character in that movie
it was one thing i was like you should cut this and save hrs
story would still work

Fr, although I think the parts that were supposed to create some sort of ironic distance (as apposed to spoon fed comedic relief) were overlooked because people are so used to obvious laugh cues and didn‚Äôt want to seem like weirdos. I was the only person to chuckle at the scene where the penguin is waddling. Unsure if that was intended or not, but I found it funny none the less.

I feel like he started out loving the system he‚Äôs always been super pro cop and pro Justice-system
If anything the arc was more about learning to help and believe in people rather than just being feared by criminals
And I guess having hope in the possibility of change could be interpreted as loving the system, but I think it was more about like believing there are good people who want to do good
Yea fear isn‚Äôt as valuable as a tool as hope is or something cheesy like that
More of a sentimental thing than a political one imo
Hard to make a mainstream film with ‚Äòreal political implications‚Äô without getting cancelled by half ur target demographic so u gotta resort to cheap moral shit (like everything else)

Chris Marker‚Äôs level is screening at metrograph  this week ‚Äî
*A woman (Laura), a computer, an invisible interlocutor: such is the setup on which LEVEL FIVE is built. She ‚Äúinherits‚Äù a task: to finish writing a video game centered on the Battle of Okinawa ‚Äì a tragedy practically unknown in the West, but whose development played a decisive role in the way World War II ended, as well as in postwar times and even our present.
A strange game, in fact. Contrary to classical strategy games whose purpose is to turn back the tide of history, this one seems willing only to reproduce history as it happened. While working on Okinawa and meeting through a rather unusual network ‚Äì parallel to Internet ‚Äì informants and even eye-witnesses to the battle (including film director Nagisa Oshima), Laura gathers pieces of the tragedy, until they start to interfere with her own life.
As in any self-respecting video game, this one proceeds by ‚Äúlevels‚Äù. Laura and her interlocutor, intoxicated by their enterprise, use this as a metaphor for life itself, and gladly attribute levels to everything around them. Will she attain LEVEL FIVE?*

i‚Äôm also so interested in this (spectacle theatre nyc) https://www.spectacletheater.com/random-man-presents-psychology-today-by-extreme-animals/
‚ÄúIn information theory, the repetition of messages tends towards the obliteration of meaning. This theorem is vitally demonstrated in Extreme Animals‚Äô video Psychology Today, which traces the algorithmically accelerated decomposition of images from the post-millennial cultural imaginary: Shrek, the Joker, and other depressive icons of our interminable financial crisis inspire a legion of exhausted reenactments by children‚Äôs birthday party workers and freelance Blender artists. Interwoven with motivational programming staged at depreciating levels of conviction, the final assembly speaks not so much to the experience of overstimulation as to the unique combination of sensory hypertrophy and apathy characteristic of life
This is presentation is the first of a collaboration between Spectacle and the Queens-based art publisher Random Man Editions, which specializes in broadcasting various genres of the indescribable and documenting fringe practices across analogue and digital media. More information available at randomman.net.‚Äù

Funny to see Girls mentioned there
I didn‚Äôt think they were particularly popular, even amongst millennials
Also, the last slide in this list features media that is far more representative of Zoomer culture than it is of millennial culture
Euphoria is not targeted towards a millennial audience, nor does it speak to the millennial experience
I agree that there‚Äôs a core list from mid - mid that probably held influence over majority millennials, however after the there are splits that a broad list can‚Äôt track.
Yeah, it‚Äôs nonsense
I feel like the soundtrack to that show alone is enough to say it is targeted to millennials, but I agree it doesn't speak to the experience.
I‚Äôm not at all aware of the soundtrack - any notable selections?
There's a lot of tracks from the bling hip hop era, that I don't think any zoomers have a relationship to.
However I say this as a capital M Millennial, so I may be wrong.
I think that show is trying to allow millennials who are desperately trying to maintain cultural relevance the opportunity to feel like they can understand and partake in zoomer culture.
Yeah there was some weird soundtrack stuff on euphoria where they are having parties and the soundtrack is rap music that would've been played at millenial high school parties

Has anyone else seen X yet? Curious to hear any thoughts about it
I saw X at a local theatre and the projector broke during the most climatic scare. Like minutes left of the movie.
Reactions
rip
Without seeing the ending, I‚Äôm unsure how I feel about it. If it could stick the landing, it was a decent horror movie with a few interesting themes. Otherwise it was fun but lacked the edge I thought it would have. Honestly I thought it was going to be much gorier and scarier than it ended up being.
I spent most of the movie thinking about how contemporary movies that are period pieces in the actually take place during lol
Damn I‚Äôm sorry about the projector situation, that sucks. Yeah I feel this‚Äîwith X & licorice pizza I spent a lot of time thinking about whether the storylines would hold up as well without nostalgia in the equation. I was definitely entertained watching it but it did feel like something I had seen before, even with its own self awareness of how tropey the plot was (really seemed like a boogie nights x Texas chainsaw massacre mashup.) idk I did like it but it did really make me think about how few horror movies & movies in general take place in a contemporary landscape
Licorice pizza felt like
Distracted by the fact it was so
yeah fr, was talking to someone older about this and they were like ‚Äúwell wasn‚Äôt paul Thomas Anderson growing up in the which made me sort of get that choice, but nostalgia fishing feels like such an easy tactic that I‚Äôm not totally sold on that defense

except that the culture from the past is part of what makes your culture now, so a good idea to be familiar with perspectives that were experienced it first hand. and you wouldn't want to pigeonhole yourself as a mere cog in  marketing nomenclature, would you?

you have to sell part of your soul and make drastic compromises in your vision to get funding to produce something like that today

it's so gorgeous and sad.  tht period in general was somewhat golden for cinema. outside of  the us you have nic roeg on fire...
The were definitely a landmark in large cinematic visions with aesthetic and narrative indulgences we rarely get today in the mainstream. Anyone with that impetus now is relegated to lower budgets usually and that obviously changes the film

I guess it brushes shoulders with ‚Äúindie sleaze‚Äù but it definitely felt more trust fund hipster gentrifier sleaze, and successful at that from what I recall. Only saw it once in If anyone is wondering it‚Äôs *not* a Tim&Eric film, Heidecker just stars.  Very dark film overall ‚Äî as someone who lived in nyc during this time and experienced a number of scenes I think it was articulating something that probably stung too many at the time it was made
Is it supposed to be a critical assessment of the remnants of that culture or is it supposed to be a retrospective criticism of the culture as a whole?
Critical assessment of remnants
Reactions
üëç
And it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôd call the entire hipster scene - it‚Äôs the wealthy contingent within, the north Williamsburg first wave condo dwellers (of that time)
Within the scene many were opposed to the displays of wealth as a somewhat misguided signifier of inauthenticity, (remnants of misdirected notions of ‚Äòselling out‚Äô back when that term was on life support before people stopped caring). it took a few more years for the inter-generational wealthy to come out as rich. In some ways the film anticipates this and is present in the detached sociopathic frictions that arise from Heidecker‚Äôs carelessness in traversing both nyc and it‚Äôs people

Work Is Hell in 'Severance'
Part satire, part thriller, this series literalizes the struggle for work-life balance with characters who undergo a procedure to split into an office-drone self and a real-world self
Hmm. Y‚Äôall should read the book it‚Äôs based off of
Kind of obsessed with this show. It has a Black Mirror and Lost and Office Space feel to it. The casting is really good I think, and the production design. Ultimately it‚Äôs got that weekly, wtf, episodic twist, frustratingly addicting thing going on, which might not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. I‚Äôve been waiting for some good critical takes on  it aside from the recaps and fan theories

i‚Äôm thinking abt this film and some others shown in this series (ex. videodrome, hackers) (also titane comes up for some reason) as narratives which explore contemp anxiety abt technology‚Äôs relationship to the human, big thoughts hours
and like how this anxiety is always connected to the body, and to social reproduction (so to gender and sexuality) - we see this here, definitely in the other films i mention like titane (if in a different way)
Reactions
heart
I bet you this server has some connection to the director
I totally agree with that grouping of movies. I like to think of them as  oblique viewings of bodies in space. The relationship of technology is interwoven, but they all share a disassociation with the body. This lets these movies really negotiate some of the core human issues with identity, but I love how distinctly queer there viewpoints are. I don‚Äôt consider Cronenberg or even Titane to be definitely trans movie, but they give great views into what it means to truly negotiate with your body.

i think there‚Äôs def room to interpret them as such!

i watched history of violence last night & thought it was excellent & my favourite 'new' cronenberg
Cronenbergs films have  always engaged with psychology and neurosis, and with his films he‚Äôs gone all in. Like he even made a movie about Freud and jung lmao. Anyone read his novel, Consumed?

Cronenberg kind of does what jarmusch does where he uses genre constraints to explore his larger thematic project

imo at least
its so damn good
watching mr. and mrs. smith now, also a perfect movie
A history of violence has a better premise, but eastern promises is just so much tighter imo
I personally just like stuff which maintains a veneer of realism that can then be broken in uncanny ways. I think EP does that exceptionally well. Really well plotted too, very suspenseful
Idk I was kind of going through a little Steven knight phase when I watched it
This guys crazy he did who wants to be a millionaire and peaky blinders but he also wrote EP, locke (which takes place entirely inside of a car), and Serenity which I think everyone in this discord should watch

bit of a weird request: I watched Scanners last night (not my favourite Cronenberg but some interesting stuff to chew re: multiple personalities, pharmaceutical vs. practice-based methods to control body and mind). There's a scene where a character holds flames in each of his upturned palms. I could swear that I've seen a Vitruvian Man style drawing/icon/symbol of a t-posed man, potentially headless, with flames in his upturned palms, but I cannot find evidence of it on the internet. Has anyone come across this symbol before?

also the context of contemplative spirituality is in the interior of the individual  and maybe sometimes the interior of a small collective. when that comes up against structures of society (esp ours) in the form of material systems things can get a little wacky lol‚Ä¶.

Did you guys find the acting  and writing in crimes of the future to be worse than a lot of his other stuff or just like, hyper stylized ? I‚Äôve only seen like two of his others so I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs kinda part of his thing or not
Cus I thought it was very purposeful but everyone else I saw it with thought it was just bad and me giving him too much self aware credit
didn't really resonate any different from his other movies to me. but also didn't think it was bad acting and the writing was meant to be somewhat funny.
saw dead ringers yesterday

HELL YEA HE DID
my fav cronenberg
I enjoyed how stilted and weird k stew was
It was kinda hot
I loved the acting as well, especially Kristen Stewart‚Äôs performance, but I also felt like the writing wasn‚Äôt his best. The entire movie felt like exposition and right when the movie was picking up for me, it endedüôÅ
i was very down for the exposition
there's definitely some pretty stilted acting in it. k stew's performance is kind of bizarre, the repair people come off weird in every scene there in
and ive seen one of those actors before in things and she's a good actor lol
I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but if you‚Äôve seen Crash then.. just know there‚Äôs a third way for acting that is neither good nor bad just‚Äî- very Unusual
Love how in crash the actors are like weird props with desires rather than realistic people
Reactions

yeah i mean crony isnt really going for naturalistic
Ya
i agree the repair people's acting was off, seemed forced, kinda ruined those scenes a bit
I enjoyed it overall, but did anyone notice how the film quality at times was like so high it felt like you were on set, and the illusion of the film disappeared? That was the other thing that ruined some scenes for me. I don't know that much about film post-production...how do you fix that type of thing reduce the frame rate or add noise or was it just bad lighting?

I have a lot to ponder, but I am here to say Crimes of the Future is a brilliant, prescient film.  Anyone who read xenofeminism should check it out.
Will see it a couple more times before I expand on my thoughts.  It dovetails nicely as a continuation of of the narrative and questions posed in Videodrome -> eXistenZ -> Cosmopolis -> Crimes of the Future.
Reactions
Incredibly juicy.  I haven‚Äôt left a film invigorated like this in some time
You‚Äôll have to elaborate as to why you believe that because I found the film to be extremely underwhelming and occasionally lacking in conviction and vision. This is not to say that it‚Äôs a bad film, it just didn‚Äôt strike me in the manner which I‚Äôd hoped it to
It‚Äôs so prescient my friend
As videodrome was
It‚Äôs the final nail in the simulacra coffin he started to build in videodrome
I understand the prescience and I found its awareness to occasionally be deeply unsettling, I just wish that the execution was as satisfying as Videodrome‚Äôs
Oh times change
He was a young man when he made that film
He didn‚Äôt even have the ending written until days before production completed
I think a younger person could have made this film and it would have just been boring overt repetitive anti-capitalist drivel hammering us in the head
Anyways I‚Äôm off for drinks to discuss, I‚Äôll circle back when I‚Äôve had some time to think
Reactions
üëç
Idk if any of his films are truly satisfying imo
I don‚Äôt mean to extend the conversation any longer than it‚Äôs gone on but I‚Äôd agree, I‚Äôm happy that a young person didn‚Äôt produce the film and I‚Äôve significant doubts as to whether they‚Äôd even be capable of doing so
Guys it‚Äôs not really about being satisfied - it‚Äôs art
Marvel movies satisfy - they entertain
Cronenberg pushes themes that are deeply personal that happen to be concerned with the near future of humankind
Reactions
Butter my ass and call me a funko pop
Reactions
üëÜ
I guess I‚Äôm a marvel boy
But I find his movies to have very dope premises that I always want him to expand upon
I think part of my dissatisfaction was that I dragged my ex and her friend to see it with me and they left disappointed
So that‚Äôs completely irrelevant to the actual thematic content of the film
Lol
They expand in your life
The expansion is here, now
That‚Äôs the idea
He opens the door
I got shitfaced watching it and can‚Äôt really recall the second half
Absolutely
What did that guy say in the movie?
‚ÄúI am a mechanic who builds doors and windows into the future‚Äù
Reactions
I think I just have world of Warcraft brain damage where I want like a whole worldbuilding lore thing to go with
We already live in the worlds he expresses - you are participating in the world building now
Reactions
What about this world had made humans resistant to pain? What material conditions exist that have people eating plastic and growing new parts? What happened
It‚Äôs implied that it‚Äôs humanity evolving
All of it is evolution
And the fear is that evolution is chaos, when it‚Äôs simply a system of order that we don‚Äôt understand, let alone control
It‚Äôs all there
Nothing is missing
I found the scenes featuring performance art to be both the most unsettling and most fascinating aspects of the film
I greatly appreciated those
Lots of excellent societal critique there
It‚Äôs better that it‚Äôs implied and the viewer imagines those pieces - it‚Äôs the subjective spaces that make films like this good. It‚Äôs an exploration of an idea, not a world
Of a NOW that we are within
And one  way to extrapolate meaning from  now is to set it in another time, another place - the distance allows for better analysis
Reactions
real
Yeah the art world critique was just bonus surface level humor
Reactions
üëÜ
I guess I just am more into explorations of world a la high fantasy shit
Sounds like you appreciate literalism
Now I‚Äôm not knocking the movie I enjoy cronenberg
No stones left unturned
Yeah
That‚Äôs cool
Derek‚Äôs making want to re-watch the film just so that I can attempt to study it in greater detail, especially the dialogue
I think I need to rewatch it clearheaded
I watched scanners last week again and really appreciated that the ending felt like a whole world was introduced
A new playing field
A whole other movie was about to start
I love that
That‚Äôs how I felt about existenz and the brood and I wanted moooooooore
Reactions
üëÜ
And then the movie ends.
Existenz literally implies that they never left the simulation
That they are lost within it
The escape is not possible nor should it be desirable
The simulacara is relative
Yeah I guess that‚Äôs one thing I really enjoy about him cus he‚Äôs also able to do it without creating this cliff hanger affect, it‚Äôs like just showing us that these characters exist in their universe beyond the scope of the movie
So yeah it ends and suddenly there‚Äôs more movie there
And the brood is an early imperfect film so ya know it‚Äôs a solid early feature for what it is
Same with shivers
Cronenberg is clearly working something out with his films because they boil down to the same themes explored in different spaces
Reminds me a lot of Hesse in that sense
The brood has this underlying theme of cults and new age self help and the dangers of that but it‚Äôs always just kinda there and never expanded upon and I want him to go in!!! He never does tho
Life rarely does
Sometimes you just enter into an entire prefabricated world that you never get the gist of
No mastery
Yeah but it‚Äôs a movie where a director has control over everything fabricated and made and shown in a world
Actually the brood was a documentary

In the lore/worldbuilding kind of way
Does he? Or is he using mythopoetic narratives to express something that was already happening in the real world at that time
*The Odyssey* isn‚Äôt a documentary, however the mythic aspects are a better way to experience the true perceptions of a time in order to digest a more wholistic  paradigm than simply reading facts and assumptions of facts in a dry PHD dissertation
Cronenberg should write a ttrpg that takes place in his cinematic universe then ill be happy ig
You can write it
Others have I think
Do you think that Cronenberg aims to convey caution or hesitance to his audience regarding the societal developments he‚Äôs examining or is he merely conveying their continued development through his work? Do you think his work has an overt moral character or is he content to be a bystander whose more so interested in examining a variety of possible ramifications that might arise from the continuation of such developments?
He conveys what is
Sorry, long question, but it‚Äôs worth considering
He shows both the caution and those that through themselves in
‚ÄúI create windows and doors into the future‚Ä¶ politics come later‚Äù
That is very, very true of today
Of all time
I couldn‚Äôt agree more
He‚Äôs a conduit
He lays it out
You can be the judge
Could you rephrase this
Simpler
I‚Äôm retarded
Tattooing the organs is clearly about capital
About pulling king tut‚Äôs tomb out of a pyramid burial chamber and throwing it into a museum. About stripping if of its meaning that we can never truly understand, because we do not have the proper paradigms of lived experience of that period.
Throwing it into the white box museum strips it of its original meaning. The amorphous shape of capitalism absorbs the unknown into its lexicon, only to alphabetize and catalogue it, and then become a rigid box yet again, once the difference is resolved
Something about the tat organs and the organ beareau reminded me of all the abortion legislation that‚Äôs going on now
Hence the vulgarity in seeing American traditional tattoos always already on the organs of something that was supposed to be new, and paradigm shattering
Instead the vulgarity of the system has already destroyed the difference, the new paradigm, as the system conspires to maintain itself
Reactions

It‚Äôs all so clear to me, I feel uniquely primed to appreciate this film
Ballard and Cronenberg were huge parts of my youth and subsequent development
I thought a significant amount about how we‚Äôve resorted to the modification of our appearance (forced aesthetic evolution of our bodies) as a means of attempting to re-assert some degree of autonomy or idiosyncratic character, despite Capitalism‚Äôs homogenizing tendencies
Exactly
There are already fetish clubs that perform surgeries in a similar fashion
It is a thing already
And this theme of where to take the transgressive behaviors has been a question for centuries
What happens when violence to an other is no longer enough?
What happens when Sex and drugs become meaningless to the addict?

We‚Äôre probably link removed from each other
This kind of thinking is endlessly fascinating for me

It‚Äôs not as if I hadn‚Äôt been exposed to similar content, it was just more so that the various acts performed in the film seemed to have been normalized to a degree I found intolerable
I really don‚Äôt like the idea of transcending humanity‚Äôs seemingly innate limitations
I find myself sympathizing with Nietzsche in that regard
Remember - it‚Äôs about the survival of those who adapt, not those that are fit.  Darwin never said the latter
Eat the damn trash can
Reactions
real
Humanity is and is not choosing
Humanity is adapting to its environment
It‚Äôs implied that it‚Äôs a willful adaptation on an unconscious level
But more consciously we still fight it because of an actual unnatural conception of humanity that we are clinging too and foolishly mistaking as natural.  Do we submit to a force greater than us?  Do we fight it?
You always already have been and always will
It was mostly digital
It‚Äôs hard to reconcile the two

Another classic and solid theme of his
Hell viggo played the same guy in eastern promises

The new ‚Äúfilmmaker mode‚Äù setting is also being championed by Martin Scorsese, Patty Jenkins, Ryan Coogler, and more.
I've said this other places but if existenz shows us what media does to the body, crimes of the future shows us what the body becomes _after_ media.
There are (almost) no screens or billboards or books in this world, and they certainly aren't functionally equivalent to how they're used now: to activate our pleasure centers into _consuming_ more..
The darkest part for me was this: all of these  systems of domination & control that exist now, exist in crimes of the world future. The difference being that in this future cronenberg envisions, the mediating effect of visual media is no longer needed because these systems of control have been fully _internalized_. Even capitals tendency to accelerate has wormed its way into our bodies through the production of new organs. (Also interesting to note there are no modern forms of transport, save a few beached container ships in the background of a few scenes)

Hi - new to the chat. I really appreciate your analysis. Love the Xenofeminism connection as a Feminist Science and Tech Studies researcher. My analytical faculties were unfortunately subdued during my viewing in theaters - after a vasovagal response took over (the facial cutting performance got me). (As a birth and postpartum doula I have seen live births, including c-sections and this has never happened to me.) I had to sit outside the theater blinded by dizziness and nausea, repeating to myself ‚Äúplease stay here, please stay here.‚Äù I stumbled into the AMC bathroom and collapsed on the ground after yelling ‚Äúhelp!‚Äù No one came. I vomited, felt a lot better, and returned to my seat to finish the movie. I went to see the film alone and was the only person in the theater during a matinee.

Anyone have thoughts on demonlover? Saw it for the first time last night, I think it has some really interesting ideas, but basically fails on a narrative and character level. It also looks terrible, but sometimes in a cool way.

Reactions

also yeah i feel about the same. it was interesting and i liked the vibe but i'm not sure if i'd rewatch it
if i had to frame what the movie was saying it would be like: whether physically (Karen) or metaphorically (Elise), capital will find a way to screw you no matter what, and in rare cases it will end up being both (in the case of Diane)
That seems about right. I also think there are a few interesting themes: desensitization via digital content, the way globalized capitalism distributes agency for cruelty and violence. It reminded me of in that you‚Äôre witnessing terrible things and slowly connecting them to mostly banal actions taken across the world.

When Isle of Dogs first premiered I watched it at a very old cinema palace and I was absurdly high on mushrooms for the duration of the movie and at one point convinced myself that it was a dramatic/fictional retelling of a true story and I ended up vomiting after the movie ended due to the relief that I did not in fact exist in the same universe as‚Ä¶ whatever the fuck message that film was trying to convey.

I feel like he started out loving the system he‚Äôs always been super pro cop and pro Justice-system
If anything the arc was more about learning to help and believe in people rather than just being feared by criminals
And I guess having hope in the possibility of change could be interpreted as loving the system, but I think it was more about like believing there are good people who want to do good
Yea fear isn‚Äôt as valuable as a tool as hope is or something cheesy like that
More of a sentimental thing than a political one imo
Hard to make a mainstream film with ‚Äòreal political implications‚Äô without getting cancelled by half ur target demographic so u gotta resort to cheap moral shit (like everything else)

Chris Marker‚Äôs level is screening at metrograph  this week ‚Äî
*A woman (Laura), a computer, an invisible interlocutor: such is the setup on which LEVEL FIVE is built. She ‚Äúinherits‚Äù a task: to finish writing a video game centered on the Battle of Okinawa ‚Äì a tragedy practically unknown in the West, but whose development played a decisive role in the way World War II ended, as well as in postwar times and even our present.
A strange game, in fact. Contrary to classical strategy games whose purpose is to turn back the tide of history, this one seems willing only to reproduce history as it happened. While working on Okinawa and meeting through a rather unusual network ‚Äì parallel to Internet ‚Äì informants and even eye-witnesses to the battle (including film director Nagisa Oshima), Laura gathers pieces of the tragedy, until they start to interfere with her own life.
As in any self-respecting video game, this one proceeds by ‚Äúlevels‚Äù. Laura and her interlocutor, intoxicated by their enterprise, use this as a metaphor for life itself, and gladly attribute levels to everything around them. Will she attain LEVEL FIVE?*

i‚Äôm also so interested in this (spectacle theatre nyc) https://www.spectacletheater.com/random-man-presents-psychology-today-by-extreme-animals/
‚ÄúIn information theory, the repetition of messages tends towards the obliteration of meaning. This theorem is vitally demonstrated in Extreme Animals‚Äô video Psychology Today, which traces the algorithmically accelerated decomposition of images from the post-millennial cultural imaginary: Shrek, the Joker, and other depressive icons of our interminable financial crisis inspire a legion of exhausted reenactments by children‚Äôs birthday party workers and freelance Blender artists. Interwoven with motivational programming staged at depreciating levels of conviction, the final assembly speaks not so much to the experience of overstimulation as to the unique combination of sensory hypertrophy and apathy characteristic of life
This is presentation is the first of a collaboration between Spectacle and the Queens-based art publisher Random Man Editions, which specializes in broadcasting various genres of the indescribable and documenting fringe practices across analogue and digital media. More information available at randomman.net.‚Äù

Funny to see Girls mentioned there
I didn‚Äôt think they were particularly popular, even amongst millennials
Also, the last slide in this list features media that is far more representative of Zoomer culture than it is of millennial culture
Euphoria is not targeted towards a millennial audience, nor does it speak to the millennial experience
I agree that there‚Äôs a core list from mid - mid that probably held influence over majority millennials, however after the there are splits that a broad list can‚Äôt track.
Yeah, it‚Äôs nonsense
I feel like the soundtrack to that show alone is enough to say it is targeted to millennials, but I agree it doesn't speak to the experience.
I‚Äôm not at all aware of the soundtrack - any notable selections?
There's a lot of tracks from the bling hip hop era, that I don't think any zoomers have a relationship to.
However I say this as a capital M Millennial, so I may be wrong.
I think that show is trying to allow millennials who are desperately trying to maintain cultural relevance the opportunity to feel like they can understand and partake in zoomer culture.
Yeah there was some weird soundtrack stuff on euphoria where they are having parties and the soundtrack is rap music that would've been played at millenial high school parties

Has anyone else seen X yet? Curious to hear any thoughts about it
I saw X at a local theatre and the projector broke during the most climatic scare. Like minutes left of the movie.
Reactions
rip
Without seeing the ending, I‚Äôm unsure how I feel about it. If it could stick the landing, it was a decent horror movie with a few interesting themes. Otherwise it was fun but lacked the edge I thought it would have. Honestly I thought it was going to be much gorier and scarier than it ended up being.
I spent most of the movie thinking about how contemporary movies that are period pieces in the actually take place during lol
Damn I‚Äôm sorry about the projector situation, that sucks. Yeah I feel this‚Äîwith X & licorice pizza I spent a lot of time thinking about whether the storylines would hold up as well without nostalgia in the equation. I was definitely entertained watching it but it did feel like something I had seen before, even with its own self awareness of how tropey the plot was (really seemed like a boogie nights x Texas chainsaw massacre mashup.) idk I did like it but it did really make me think about how few horror movies & movies in general take place in a contemporary landscape
Licorice pizza felt like
Distracted by the fact it was so
yeah fr, was talking to someone older about this and they were like ‚Äúwell wasn‚Äôt paul Thomas Anderson growing up in the which made me sort of get that choice, but nostalgia fishing feels like such an easy tactic that I‚Äôm not totally sold on that defense

except that the culture from the past is part of what makes your culture now, so a good idea to be familiar with perspectives that were experienced it first hand. and you wouldn't want to pigeonhole yourself as a mere cog in  marketing nomenclature, would you?

Re: McCabe and mrs Miller - it‚Äôs one of those rare works where the period set was being constructed during filming, and was also tied into the narrative of a developing town on the frontier

you have to sell part of your soul and make drastic compromises in your vision to get funding to produce something like that today
I doubt it would ever get made
it's so gorgeous and sad.  tht period in general was somewhat golden for cinema. outside of  the us you have nic roeg on fire...
The were definitely a landmark in large cinematic visions with aesthetic and narrative indulgences we rarely get today in the mainstream. Anyone with that impetus now is relegated to lower budgets usually and that obviously changes the film
Indeed!
one of my fav narratives on american failure is about how all of that came to implode. this book is a great, if nerdy, read:

I guess it brushes shoulders with ‚Äúindie sleaze‚Äù but it definitely felt more trust fund hipster gentrifier sleaze, and successful at that from what I recall. Only saw it once in If anyone is wondering it‚Äôs *not* a Tim&Eric film, Heidecker just stars.  Very dark film overall ‚Äî as someone who lived in nyc during this time and experienced a number of scenes I think it was articulating something that probably stung too many at the time it was made
Is it supposed to be a critical assessment of the remnants of that culture or is it supposed to be a retrospective criticism of the culture as a whole?
Critical assessment of remnants
Reactions
üëç
And it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôd call the entire hipster scene - it‚Äôs the wealthy contingent within, the north Williamsburg first wave condo dwellers (of that time)
Within the scene many were opposed to the displays of wealth as a somewhat misguided signifier of inauthenticity, (remnants of misdirected notions of ‚Äòselling out‚Äô back when that term was on life support before people stopped caring). it took a few more years for the inter-generational wealthy to come out as rich. In some ways the film anticipates this and is present in the detached sociopathic frictions that arise from Heidecker‚Äôs carelessness in traversing both nyc and it‚Äôs people

i‚Äôm thinking abt this film and some others shown in this series (ex. videodrome, hackers) (also titane comes up for some reason) as narratives which explore contemp anxiety abt technology‚Äôs relationship to the human, big thoughts hours
and like how this anxiety is always connected to the body, and to social reproduction (so to gender and sexuality) - we see this here, definitely in the other films i mention like titane (if in a different way)
Reactions
heart
I bet you this server has some connection to the director
I totally agree with that grouping of movies. I like to think of them as  oblique viewings of bodies in space. The relationship of technology is interwoven, but they all share a disassociation with the body. This lets these movies really negotiate some of the core human issues with identity, but I love how distinctly queer there viewpoints are. I don‚Äôt consider Cronenberg or even Titane to be definitely trans movie, but they give great views into what it means to truly negotiate with your body.

i think there‚Äôs def room to interpret them as such!

i watched history of violence last night & thought it was excellent & my favourite 'new' cronenberg
Cronenbergs films have  always engaged with psychology and neurosis, and with his films he‚Äôs gone all in. Like he even made a movie about Freud and jung lmao. Anyone read his novel, Consumed?

its so damn good
watching mr. and mrs. smith now, also a perfect movie
A history of violence has a better premise, but eastern promises is just so much tighter imo
I personally just like stuff which maintains a veneer of realism that can then be broken in uncanny ways. I think EP does that exceptionally well. Really well plotted too, very suspenseful
Idk I was kind of going through a little Steven knight phase when I watched it
This guys crazy he did who wants to be a millionaire and peaky blinders but he also wrote EP, locke (which takes place entirely inside of a car), and Serenity which I think everyone in this discord should watch

Ed was a mentor of his. A production designer for local theater stuff up there. Quite an eccentric character, really great guy. Rob put us together on a project of his

bit of a weird request: I watched Scanners last night (not my favourite Cronenberg but some interesting stuff to chew re: multiple personalities, pharmaceutical vs. practice-based methods to control body and mind). There's a scene where a character holds flames in each of his upturned palms. I could swear that I've seen a Vitruvian Man style drawing/icon/symbol of a t-posed man, potentially headless, with flames in his upturned palms, but I cannot find evidence of it on the internet. Has anyone come across this symbol before?

also the context of contemplative spirituality is in the interior of the individual  and maybe sometimes the interior of a small collective. when that comes up against structures of society (esp ours) in the form of material systems things can get a little wacky lol‚Ä¶.

Did you guys find the acting  and writing in crimes of the future to be worse than a lot of his other stuff or just like, hyper stylized ? I‚Äôve only seen like two of his others so I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs kinda part of his thing or not
Cus I thought it was very purposeful but everyone else I saw it with thought it was just bad and me giving him too much self aware credit
didn't really resonate any different from his other movies to me. but also didn't think it was bad acting and the writing was meant to be somewhat funny.
saw dead ringers yesterday
Jeremy Irons killed that

HELL YEA HE DID
my fav cronenberg
I enjoyed how stilted and weird k stew was
It was kinda hot
I loved the acting as well, especially Kristen Stewart‚Äôs performance, but I also felt like the writing wasn‚Äôt his best. The entire movie felt like exposition and right when the movie was picking up for me, it endedüôÅ
i was very down for the exposition
there's definitely some pretty stilted acting in it. k stew's performance is kind of bizarre, the repair people come off weird in every scene there in
and ive seen one of those actors before in things and she's a good actor lol
I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but if you‚Äôve seen Crash then.. just know there‚Äôs a third way for acting that is neither good nor bad just‚Äî- very Unusual
Love how in crash the actors are like weird props with desires rather than realistic people
Reactions
based
yeah i mean crony isnt really going for naturalistic
Ya
i agree the repair people's acting was off, seemed forced, kinda ruined those scenes a bit
I enjoyed it overall, but did anyone notice how the film quality at times was like so high it felt like you were on set, and the illusion of the film disappeared? That was the other thing that ruined some scenes for me. I don't know that much about film post-production...how do you fix that type of thing reduce the frame rate or add noise or was it just bad lighting?

I have a lot to ponder, but I am here to say Crimes of the Future is a brilliant, prescient film.  Anyone who read xenofeminism should check it out.
Will see it a couple more times before I expand on my thoughts.  It dovetails nicely as a continuation of of the narrative and questions posed in Videodrome -> eXistenZ -> Cosmopolis -> Crimes of the Future.
Reactions
Incredibly juicy.  I haven‚Äôt left a film invigorated like this in some time
You‚Äôll have to elaborate as to why you believe that because I found the film to be extremely underwhelming and occasionally lacking in conviction and vision. This is not to say that it‚Äôs a bad film, it just didn‚Äôt strike me in the manner which I‚Äôd hoped it to
It‚Äôs so prescient my friend
As videodrome was
It‚Äôs the final nail in the simulacra coffin he started to build in videodrome
I understand the prescience and I found its awareness to occasionally be deeply unsettling, I just wish that the execution was as satisfying as Videodrome‚Äôs
Oh times change
He was a young man when he made that film
He didn‚Äôt even have the ending written until days before production completed
I think a younger person could have made this film and it would have just been boring overt repetitive anti-capitalist drivel hammering us in the head
Anyways I‚Äôm off for drinks to discuss, I‚Äôll circle back when I‚Äôve had some time to think
Reactions
üëç
Idk if any of his films are truly satisfying imo
I don‚Äôt mean to extend the conversation any longer than it‚Äôs gone on but I‚Äôd agree, I‚Äôm happy that a young person didn‚Äôt produce the film and I‚Äôve significant doubts as to whether they‚Äôd even be capable of doing so
Guys it‚Äôs not really about being satisfied - it‚Äôs art
Marvel movies satisfy - they entertain
Cronenberg pushes themes that are deeply personal that happen to be concerned with the near future of humankind
Reactions
Butter my ass and call me a funko pop

üëÜ
I guess I‚Äôm a marvel boy
But I find his movies to have very dope premises that I always want him to expand upon
I think part of my dissatisfaction was that I dragged my ex and her friend to see it with me and they left disappointed
So that‚Äôs completely irrelevant to the actual thematic content of the film
Lol
They expand in your life
The expansion is here, now
That‚Äôs the idea
He opens the door
I got shitfaced watching it and can‚Äôt really recall the second half
Absolutely
What did that guy say in the movie?
‚ÄúI am a mechanic who builds doors and windows into the future‚Äù
Reactions
I think I just have world of Warcraft brain damage where I want like a whole worldbuilding lore thing to go with
We already live in the worlds he expresses - you are participating in the world building now
Reactions
What about this world had made humans resistant to pain? What material conditions exist that have people eating plastic and growing new parts? What happened
It‚Äôs implied that it‚Äôs humanity evolving
All of it is evolution
And the fear is that evolution is chaos, when it‚Äôs simply a system of order that we don‚Äôt understand, let alone control
It‚Äôs all there
Nothing is missing
I found the scenes featuring performance art to be both the most unsettling and most fascinating aspects of the film
I greatly appreciated those
Lots of excellent societal critique there
It‚Äôs better that it‚Äôs implied and the viewer imagines those pieces - it‚Äôs the subjective spaces that make films like this good. It‚Äôs an exploration of an idea, not a world
Of a NOW that we are within
And one  way to extrapolate meaning from  now is to set it in another time, another place - the distance allows for better analysis
Reactions
real
Yeah the art world critique was just bonus surface level humor
Reactions
üëÜ
I guess I just am more into explorations of world a la high fantasy shit
Sounds like you appreciate literalism
Now I‚Äôm not knocking the movie I enjoy cronenberg
No stones left unturned
Yeah
That‚Äôs cool
Derek‚Äôs making want to re-watch the film just so that I can attempt to study it in greater detail, especially the dialogue
I think I need to rewatch it clearheaded
I watched scanners last week again and really appreciated that the ending felt like a whole world was introduced
A new playing field
A whole other movie was about to start
I love that
That‚Äôs how I felt about existenz and the brood and I wanted moooooooore
Reactions
üëÜ
And then the movie ends.
Existenz literally implies that they never left the simulation
That they are lost within it
The escape is not possible nor should it be desirable
The simulacara is relative
Yeah I guess that‚Äôs one thing I really enjoy about him cus he‚Äôs also able to do it without creating this cliff hanger affect, it‚Äôs like just showing us that these characters exist in their universe beyond the scope of the movie
So yeah it ends and suddenly there‚Äôs more movie there
And the brood is an early imperfect film so ya know it‚Äôs a solid early feature for what it is
Same with shivers
Cronenberg is clearly working something out with his films because they boil down to the same themes explored in different spaces
Reminds me a lot of Hesse in that sense
The brood has this underlying theme of cults and new age self help and the dangers of that but it‚Äôs always just kinda there and never expanded upon and I want him to go in!!! He never does tho
Life rarely does
Sometimes you just enter into an entire prefabricated world that you never get the gist of
No mastery
Yeah but it‚Äôs a movie where a director has control over everything fabricated and made and shown in a world
Actually the brood was a documentary
That‚Äôs why I love loving here - I enter into entire universes that should not exist but almost always have and will
They aren‚Äôt for me to know unless I want to dedicate my life to them
But I can‚Äôt, so all I have are my impressions of moving through those universes during a fixed moment in space time
I get where you‚Äôre coming from here and I think I just disagree bc I play dnd and want to know everything about everything
Reactions
real
In the lore/worldbuilding kind of way
Does he? Or is he using mythopoetic narratives to express something that was already happening in the real world at that time
*The Odyssey* isn‚Äôt a documentary, however the mythic aspects are a better way to experience the true perceptions of a time in order to digest a more wholistic  paradigm than simply reading facts and assumptions of facts in a dry PHD dissertation
Cronenberg should write a ttrpg that takes place in his cinematic universe then ill be happy ig
You can write it
Others have I think
Do you think that Cronenberg aims to convey caution or hesitance to his audience regarding the societal developments he‚Äôs examining or is he merely conveying their continued development through his work? Do you think his work has an overt moral character or is he content to be a bystander whose more so interested in examining a variety of possible ramifications that might arise from the continuation of such developments?
He conveys what is
Sorry, long question, but it‚Äôs worth considering
He shows both the caution and those that through themselves in
‚ÄúI create windows and doors into the future‚Ä¶ politics come later‚Äù
That is very, very true of today
Of all time
I couldn‚Äôt agree more
He‚Äôs a conduit
He lays it out
You can be the judge
Could you rephrase this
Simpler
I‚Äôm retarded
Tattooing the organs is clearly about capital
About pulling king tut‚Äôs tomb out of a pyramid burial chamber and throwing it into a museum. About stripping if of its meaning that we can never truly understand, because we do not have the proper paradigms of lived experience of that period.
Throwing it into the white box museum strips it of its original meaning. The amorphous shape of capitalism absorbs the unknown into its lexicon, only to alphabetize and catalogue it, and then become a rigid box yet again, once the difference is resolved
Something about the tat organs and the organ beareau reminded me of all the abortion legislation that‚Äôs going on now
Hence the vulgarity in seeing American traditional tattoos always already on the organs of something that was supposed to be new, and paradigm shattering
Instead the vulgarity of the system has already destroyed the difference, the new paradigm, as the system conspires to maintain itself
Reactions
üëÜ
It‚Äôs all so clear to me, I feel uniquely primed to appreciate this film
Ballard and Cronenberg were huge parts of my youth and subsequent development
I thought a significant amount about how we‚Äôve resorted to the modification of our appearance (forced aesthetic evolution of our bodies) as a means of attempting to re-assert some degree of autonomy or idiosyncratic character, despite Capitalism‚Äôs homogenizing tendencies
Exactly
There are already fetish clubs that perform surgeries in a similar fashion
It is a thing already
And this theme of where to take the transgressive behaviors has been a question for centuries
What happens when violence to an other is no longer enough?
What happens when Sex and drugs become meaningless to the addict?
Reactions
What is next within a system comprised of desiring machines?  Of people that see themselves as living desires?

I need to talk to Cronenberg before he dies
Get him on pm
I will ask around
We‚Äôre probably link removed from each other
This kind of thinking is endlessly fascinating for me
That‚Äôs why I found the scenes featuring dissection and mutilation so hard to stomach - I had to avert my eyes numerous times because I felt as if I grasped the enormity of the repercussions of such actions
Damn I ate a bag of popcorn

Maybe I‚Äôve just read and watched way too much extreme and atypical libidinal stuff
It was just an aesthetic for me
An archetypal language of fleshy symbols that harkens back to his earlier films
I was thinking that the implants in his partners head reminded me of Hecate. A representation of the unconscious desire to adapt literally bursting through (her skull) into consciousness.

It‚Äôs not as if I hadn‚Äôt been exposed to similar content, it was just more so that the various acts performed in the film seemed to have been normalized to a degree I found intolerable
I really don‚Äôt like the idea of transcending humanity‚Äôs seemingly innate limitations
I find myself sympathizing with Nietzsche in that regard
Remember - it‚Äôs about the survival of those who adapt, not those that are fit.  Darwin never said the latter
Eat the damn trash can
Reactions
real
Humanity is and is not choosing
Humanity is adapting to its environment
It‚Äôs implied that it‚Äôs a willful adaptation on an unconscious level
But more consciously we still fight it because of an actual unnatural conception of humanity that we are clinging too and foolishly mistaking as natural.  Do we submit to a force greater than us?  Do we fight it?
You always already have been and always will
It was mostly digital
It‚Äôs hard to reconcile the two
Right
That‚Äôs why we die

Because we can‚Äôt
I‚Äôve fully accepted the trashcan

You literally don‚Äôt have to - just die
I know I‚Äôm infertile I can just sense it
Cronenberg often has some shadowy corporate or state agency attempting to control or suppress narratives of progress
Reactions
Another classic and solid theme of his
Hell viggo played the same guy in eastern promises
I see a lot of cronenberg‚Äôs career coming together here
And I expect his next film to be a climax of sorts
For whatever reason, this conversation has made me slightly more comfortable with my current existence and its intrinsic futility than I did maybe even as recently as minutes ago

The new ‚Äúfilmmaker mode‚Äù setting is also being championed by Martin Scorsese, Patty Jenkins, Ryan Coogler, and more.
I've said this other places but if existenz shows us what media does to the body, crimes of the future shows us what the body becomes _after_ media.
There are (almost) no screens or billboards or books in this world, and they certainly aren't functionally equivalent to how they're used now: to activate our pleasure centers into _consuming_ more..
The darkest part for me was this: all of these  systems of domination & control that exist now, exist in crimes of the world future. The difference being that in this future cronenberg envisions, the mediating effect of visual media is no longer needed because these systems of control have been fully _internalized_. Even capitals tendency to accelerate has wormed its way into our bodies through the production of new organs. (Also interesting to note there are no modern forms of transport, save a few beached container ships in the background of a few scenes)

Hi - new to the chat. I really appreciate your analysis. Love the Xenofeminism connection as a Feminist Science and Tech Studies researcher. My analytical faculties were unfortunately subdued during my viewing in theaters - after a vasovagal response took over (the facial cutting performance got me). (As a birth and postpartum doula I have seen live births, including c-sections and this has never happened to me.) I had to sit outside the theater blinded by dizziness and nausea, repeating to myself ‚Äúplease stay here, please stay here.‚Äù I stumbled into the AMC bathroom and collapsed on the ground after yelling ‚Äúhelp!‚Äù No one came. I vomited, felt a lot better, and returned to my seat to finish the movie. I went to see the film alone and was the only person in the theater during a matinee. Word to the wise, maybe this movie and it‚Äôs important social critiques are better understood via laptop.

Anyone have thoughts on demonlover? Saw it for the first time last night, I think it has some really interesting ideas, but basically fails on a narrative and character level. It also looks terrible, but sometimes in a cool way.

Reactions

also yeah i feel about the same. it was interesting and i liked the vibe but i'm not sure if i'd rewatch it
if i had to frame what the movie was saying it would be like: whether physically (Karen) or metaphorically (Elise), capital will find a way to screw you no matter what, and in rare cases it will end up being both (in the case of Diane)
That seems about right. I also think there are a few interesting themes: desensitization via digital content, the way globalized capitalism distributes agency for cruelty and violence. It reminded me of in that you‚Äôre witnessing terrible things and slowly connecting them to mostly banal actions taken across the world.

When Isle of Dogs first premiered I watched it at a very old cinema palace and I was absurdly high on mushrooms for the duration of the movie and at one point convinced myself that it was a dramatic/fictional retelling of a true story and I ended up vomiting after the movie ended due to the relief that I did not in fact exist in the same universe as‚Ä¶ whatever the fuck message that film was trying to convey.

Anyone else noticing a recent uptick of Hollywood blockbusters that fundamentally obscure the CIA‚Äôs various historical MKULTRA programs?  Given that events like the CIA‚Äôs orchestration of Jonestown are now popular Twitter conspiracy fodder, the timing of this movie is interesting.  Tarantino‚Äôs last film is another example; it overshadowed Tom O‚ÄôNeil‚Äôs *Chaos* book as it was making waves in firmly connecting Manson to the CIA.

I know this cord focuses more on systemic issues, however I think it‚Äôs interesting to observe ‚Äúnon-political‚Äù popular media swell to eclipse very specific narratives that are taken for granted in spaces like this.

Well the CIA‚Äôs Hollywood department is quite active and public, however I‚Äôm getting at this trend of biopics that ostensibly place themselves as the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù account, or are so phantasmagorical that their simplistic fiction is desired more than any real comprehension of historical events whose hidden mechanisms reach into the present.  There are definitely hype cycles to these things and figures like this will continue to be resurrected with each generation.  I just know the reality of the Jonestown programming camp is trending in our circles, making a larger impact than it historically has when discussed.  The spectacle of these biopics seems to intensify, as if in response.
looked it up and turns out they were a few months apart, but still

Alright alright I wasn‚Äôt going to say anything but Zimmer blows. His studio is modeled after an century Viennese brothel and when I hear his sounds I can‚Äôt help but think of ‚Äúle epic‚Äù superhero movies and blockbusters, just like casting Jason mamoa brings a similar association.

all time favs
havent seen it since high school
Absolutely, certainly should be screened here. I think Stalker would be a great Tarkovsky starting point for the cell. The dilemma posed by the room at the center of the zone concerns the realization of the unconscious desires of the three characters whose representative archetypes I feel are quite relevent here and to the modern day. The exploration of Aristotelian unity is relevant as well (location, action, and time).

At one point, there was talk of doing a discord livestream walkthrough of Andrei Rublev. Sort of a ‚ÄúTarkovsky for people who don‚Äôt think they can watch Tarkovsky‚Äù.

I watched the new james bond my take away was
the opening sequence where a bunch of guns spiral in a double helix and then shoot bullets to create a stream which connects each gun node to the other side of the helix was incredible and i'd like to recreate it for an artwork
I would like to be hired to make the opening sequence for a bond movie but realize that they are basically committing suicide with the franchise after this film
Ana de Armas is beautiful and I love her, my new celebrity crush
The movie was like an hour too long and pretty boring
it gets bags of popcorn and a soda pop from me because i enjoyed some of it if you let yourself just take in the bond formula, but it drags on long enough that you get tired of it

Hunger is good, Wind that Shakes the Barley is good
Reactions
Wind that shakes the Barley focusing on the sort of beginnings of the formation of the organised IRA, and Hunger is much more recent, and about my mother‚Äôs famous neighbour lol
In the name of the father is also great, about innocent men wrongly imprisoned under the terrorism act of Britain, less of a focus on the IRA and more of a focus on the corruption of the British government
There‚Äôs also quite a lot on The Troubles in general
ah yes the least photogenic political martyr of all time, mr sands
Hahaha my mum said he was hot!!!!
Wind that shakes the barley is a fuckin banger
Great illustration of why you shouldn‚Äôt interrupt a couple dudes playing hurling
TRIVIA that was actually not hurling that they‚Äôre playing in the opening scene
Oh fuck really? Enlighten me
Michael collins is a good movie and it does accurately depict how much of an asshole my namesake was
Snape as Dev, inspired casting
I‚Äôll ask my da can‚Äôt remember the name
Yeah no offence but not the best name in the book in that sense, but I really do like the name Eamon

and they just make more bad formal work afterwards

Mainstream caters to the lowest common denominator and the most sellable tropes. It always looks like shit, appreciate whatever you can from it or just look elsewhere know what I mean?  There are so many great pieces of historical media that speak better to now, than most stuff that gets pushed to the surface today.  Anything new that does encapsulate some element of the zeitgeist today often doesn‚Äôt have the budget or connections to be impactful or visible. I know that all sounds obvious but it is what it is
I was up last night watching this Abel Ferrara executive produced comedy about an NYC techno store going under in The owner Keith is a down and out trance DJ who is struggling to cope with the changing cultural climate, so he organizes a rave in a final effort to save the store. Felt incredibly relevant to today. Low budget but doesn‚Äôt look like shit, its raw unpolished aesthetic lends to the authenticity of the story.

I got on the internet, old internet during the era and made a decision to digest as much of the expanded cinema cannon as possible, as well as familiarize myself with as much music as humanly possible. Chat rooms were helpful in this sense back then, and I‚Äôve carried this sensibility with me to the present.

People have so much energy to critique, to digest lore, and to write new stories to fill plot holes of mediocre entertainment.
The ability to digest is always present and the desire for new media, for new narratives; it‚Äôs at the core of humanity.  These desires have just been redirected into very narrow tracts for consumptive entertainment.  When these avenues become too crammed with content, people will seek adjacent routes again.

I watched ‚ÄòThree Days of the Condor‚Äô after, to sort of balance the viewing.  Both films are critical of covert CIA activities during the same era, although serving entirely different agendas.  Condor is a Hollywood produced film about a bookish analyst whose team has been suddenly murdered, presumably by his own colleagues or something more covert, so he‚Äôs been framed for the murders.  Definitely more of a dad flick but I got a kick out of how the ‚Äòmild mannered analyst‚Äô described his job:

it didn't know if it wanted to be a weird like buddy cop without the cop comedy or a sopranos gangster story. way over acted. best thing was jared leto in a fat suit and al pacino being a gucci version of scarface. truly bizarre and way too long and over indulgent. if it didnt have a story to base its entire script on it would have fallen apart

the accent stuff is such a trip
I know it's common practice, but for whatever reason it drove me particularly crazy in this one. Americans pretending to be italians speaking english to other italians in italy.
yeah it was strange - i know movies have a hard time figuring out when to use what language in a movie that is technically in a different country for and by an english speaking crew/audience
but in this movie it was particularly weird, like i kept imagining everyone as either a first gen or second gen italian american depending on what version of an accent they used lol
and when a language was introduced it got even less clear

We can talk about it in VC sometime if you‚Äôd like. I know there are some other opinions on where to start with Tarkovsky but I think viewing the any of his films (I‚Äôd start with stalker, it was my introduction) followed by a discussion on a following day to allow time for digestion would be great.  Personally find his work more relevant to my life with each passing year.
Whether you are considering it from Bergson or Deleuze‚Äôs perspective, the core concept is that lived time, time that endures, is time that flows, time in which the past and future penetrate into the present in the form of memory and desire.
Reactions
heart
Consider experiences in your life in which time stretches when it seems to move more slowly (ie: when bored), and compacts during moments of crisis, while we seem to dip deeper into memory at some points (ie: moments of dreaming, fantasy, reverie), and more shallowly during moments of action.

‚ù§Ô∏è
Referencing my copies of Cinema to better answer your question - There are films in which we see mirrorings of various sorts. Mirrors provide us with virtual images of actual entities. A person seeing their actual face in the mirror sees a virtual image of their face. What is the temporal status of their face? It seems as if the time of the mirror exists in a perpetual past-future, or future-past of the present of the actual image it reflects (ie: what exactly are you looking at?) This is where the notion of the mirror image comes from.
Mirrors are also people, from a more Lacanian standpoint similar two characters in a film that resemble each other are a mirror.
If time is marked by clocks, it‚Äôs by using physical difference in the world around us to mark degrees of change in space. (Space is separated from time in this metaphor; space demarcates time).
So, what happens when Mirrors are encountered in film (or life for that matter)?  They disrupt one‚Äôs  linear perception or flow or time.  What happens when space starts to resemble itself (with more mirrors)?  What happens when we encounter a hallway of mirrors, aka the crystal?  Linearity is disrupted and our notions of before and after break down.
Why does this matter?
One thing you learn watching image crystals is to suspend your judgment of images, because you will never know which aspect of an image will be selected for radical reworking later in the film. In this manner, each image becomes suffused with past/future, time, context, relation, and difference. It becomes virtual, less directly present, pure difference lurks between the very pores of the aspects of the image. What is present is an imaging of time, a depiction of time, of pure difference, in the image itself.
A direct imaging of time.
Reactions
I think metahaven may have actually plotted this out on an x,y,z axis graph for clarity.  If not I‚Äôm going to do it
I tried watching Tarkovsky for the first time earlier this month. Went with Solaris. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not a great start but I also may just not like him.

I‚Äôve never once conceived of mirrors as a destabilizing force that disrupts the tenuous linearity we construct to ensure that we can function as humans
Reactions
eyesglow
I think that people in are experiencing a rapidly accelerating amount of mirrors in their lives that create unintelligible complex prisms beyond comprehension.  With the free flow of infinite information, along with exposure to specific viewpoints creating ever more polarized experiences, the desire for linearity, non-mirrored, entertainment increases.
Reactions
I think this is a recursive pattern across time that signifies a great paradigm shift that eventually will be a common mode of understanding.  We seem to return to mirrorless linearity across history, but I often wonder if we will enter into a zone of comprehension in which time prisms are the norm of experiences.  If linear time is simply a mental construct, then a more real experience should be that of the hallway of mirrors.
Reactions
Eh try not to think about it and enjoy the film lol.  The characters are wonderful and the dilemma presented by the room at the heart of the zone, to me, is the dilemma of our time.
Tarkovsky‚Äôs balance of diagetic and non-diagetic sounds are mirrors of their own ‚ù§Ô∏è
Reactions
heart
do you feel your analysis is evident in the film itself? I started my academic curiosities as a film reviewer in high school and pursued film studies but found it to be complete incoherent garbage totally disconnected with my life ‚Äî and sometimes from the artist's own intent. There's a semi-famous story of an examination of the Frankenstein and its usage of black frames interspersed throughout the movie. I don't have the link to the actual article but it was called a compelling critique and the director came out and said "yeah we just screwed up putting together the final reel so there's missing frames that are black."
I'm very eager for a deeper connection to art, but I've been disappointed at some critical analysis bringing things to the art that's not there at all.
I‚Äôm curious if you think there‚Äôs space at all for bringing something outside the artists intent to the work. If the response/critical analysis is incoherent that‚Äôs an issue, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything inherently wrong with using contextual information outside the work to analyze it
Reactions
stancestrong
yeah I do agree there can often be analysis beyond the artist's intent. I think I subscribe to death of an author.
like did Verhoeven intend for Basic Instinct to be integral to sexual freedom and spotlighting bisexual characters? almost certainly not
I stated my understanding of Time Crystals, and tried to illustrate it beyond the dimension of film for clarity‚Äôs sake.  Images are never just images for Deleuze but if they are for you, I respect that.
Time *is* a purely mental construct, and linear perception is a result of how we structure the external world and our relationship to it.  The virtual is not merely the past, and memory, but also the future, and fantasy. I believe that access to the virtual is essential to human existence, and that the linear experience of external events in our daily lives can vastly limit our access to the virtual
I have no entry to Deleuze and if you intuit I have a position in relation to his view it is an unexamined one. I don't think I'm lost in what you've shared so far I'm just reminded of this XKCD

However Tarkovsky wrote extensively about his conceptions of time, and his intentions do align with a deleuzian or bergsonian analysis
I was giving an example to @idols.ico 's point that there can be critique that exists outside of artist's intent that is worthwhile. I think they were saying ‚Äî in response to my question on if your insight is present in the art ‚Äî that it doesn't have to be to be worthwhile.
Reactions
‚ù§Ô∏è
Gotcha!  That all being said, the analysis is definitely not why I like his movies. It‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve come to understand and agree with.  I do feel that time crystals, or disruptions in one‚Äôs linear perception of time really do allow for judgement and bias to be dispensed with, and a potential for openness to difference.  That‚Äôs huge.
Reactions
I tend to appreciate artists in any medium who create these timeless, or perhaps detached virtual spaces. I see unlimited potential in those moments that are essential and frankly I‚Äôm sure most people do as well, even if not in those terms.

I think Tarkovsky def was intentional with his production as an alignment of his ideas, belief, history, and like lived action. If there‚Äôs a director you could say the analysis springs forth honestly it‚Äôs him. I also believe that even if something wasn‚Äôt intentional there‚Äôs a subconscious conduit in the work that activates the viewer and like the Frankenstein thing, the  filmmakers folly isn‚Äôt the work, the work received is the work!

We shouldn‚Äôt let us be captured by schematizing machines
Lol
Do you believe that there‚Äôs a way by which to preserve certain aspects of industrial society while discarding of schematizing systems and/or constructs? I think of Zerzan‚Äôs writing on agriculture when attempting to confront the tyranny of the clock upon the foundations of human society, but that necessarily precludes any attempt at preserving the benefits of technological advancement
Oof tough, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way back, our minds and body and too shaped by it now to even comprehend living beyond it, except in like art, film, meditation, and drug circumstances.
I gotta read more zerzan
Reactions
doubt
But in some regard there‚Äôs always been a historic sense of organizing time
It‚Äôs just how absolute is it now
Despite a strong affection for theorists who are advocates of the liberatory potential of technology, my anti-tech sentiments inform much of my thinking regarding the deconstruction of entrenched behaviors and associated structures
Would you say that was even true in pre-agricultural societies? You can argue that time was far less regimented and specific behaviors were based upon reoccurring events (namely migratory patterns and the change of seasons) but such a conception of time stands in contrast to the conception that emerged from agricultural society
I kept this in mind throughout the entirety of the film and I found the manner by which Tarkovsky subtly manipulates the definition of a diagetic sound within the film to be a phenomenal - there are numerous instances where certain sounds are first made apparent to the viewer before the characters are made aware of it, alongside instances where it‚Äôs nearly impossible to discern if the characters can hear what exactly the audience is hearing
Reactions
ü§ç
That‚Äôs the beauty of the concepts like mirror hallways and time crystals.  I think what you‚Äôre describing affects the viewer‚Äôs perception of time with or without their knowledge of such.  That‚Äôs good filmmaking IMO. Tarkovsky masterfully lulls the viewer into virtual spaces, (or zones in the language of the film). Stalker is crafted in a way where I think numerous meaning can be inferred from our experience in the zone (of both the film experience itself and the location within).  It‚Äôs been a while but from what I recall he sees his viewers in the camp of the rational atheist skeptic, the spiritual believer (Christ consciousness), and the supernatural believer.  Each viewer can leave the film with a potent experience of meaning, even if they don‚Äôt share Tarkovsky‚Äôs own view of the world.
Reactions
heart
I‚Äôm in complete agreement, as those distinct sentiments and perspectives are present in each of the three characters or that each reflects a distinct perspective towards an entity such as the Zone
Awesome.  You‚Äôll find the same concepts across all of his films. Andrei Rublev really highlights these notions.
There also appears to exist a conflict between actions dictated by pure emotion and pure reason, whose consequences lead to meditation upon the circumstantial value of each sensation
Yeah.  The skeptical scientist (STEM), the famous cynical writer with writers block (liberal arts, humanities) and the stalker (persecuted christ, perhaps to a fault) all are at odds in how to resolve the question of the room.
Imagine being on the precipice of your inner most desire, only to know that you can never be certain of your truest desire.  Is our non-integrated shadow our truest expression?  The movie is intended to awaken the viewer to the knowledge that the terrain beyond their conscious mind is largely closed to them, and that it is there where their deepest desire smolders.  How can you ever be confident on what exactly is your deepest desire?

dang reading this made me like the film even more nice
I think the idea that *intelligence may be the ability to harness the powers of the surrounding world, without destroying it* is a profound concept to consider ‚Ä¶
Yeah it‚Äôs a haunting thought. I empathize tremendously with the characters and sometimes I think Tarkovsky was able to do a better job of what Hesse was attempting to do repeatedly with his novels, as they have similar character dilemmas at play.
Sorry I didn‚Äôt respond to the stuff above
But I wanted to respond here and say they‚Äôre both great but tarkovsky has the benefit of the dimension of space that film captures that writing can‚Äôt or I guess some poets grapple with that but Hesse doesn‚Äôt
The characters in stalker are moving as we move through a space neither of us have an understanding of, maybe it‚Äôs the brain itself the space of imagining, but we‚Äôre embodying it through the process of viewing
He was particular exceptional at that

The director of ‚ÄúLicorice Pizza‚Äù discusses his writing process, choosing actors, and how you can tell when you are on a good film set.
PTA had an interesting take - pretty much that maybe superhero movies can be a good life raft to keep the industry alive; as long as the category of ‚Äògoing to movies‚Äô still makes sense, there will be money kicking around for other, riskier shit to be made

I don‚Äôt think propaganda films such as the marvel movies have any relevance to art nowadays; maybe in the past such films were influential works,  but with the democratization of art I think these films can be completely ignored in a discussion of art or film
Their influence on the medium is economic, not artistic

Yep.  I‚Äôd add that rarely are trilogies crafted across stretches of time, let alone decades in such a considered manner.  The kernel of the initial idea is explored as it unfolds across both lived and cinematic time, as opposed to the more typical trend of three films conceived and executed in relative succession.
Reactions
I just realized those three movies are the same director
Cronenberg been working forever
I think I‚Äôm the only person who enjoyed his performance in The Rover.  It was actually the first film I saw starring Pattinson.  I recall going to the theater to see something else that was sold out, so I wandered into an empty theater to see the other film playing, which happened to be The Rover.  I found him compelling in the role.
Certainly a flawed film, however the long soundless stretches of driving across barren desert with the basinski score was moving

Putting cosmopolis on the list after reading the chat
I think his most mainstream films are probably The Fly, Eastern Promises and A History of Violence.  Viggo Moretensen and Cronenberg are actually working together again for a new film, titled *Crimes of the Future.* (not a remake of his film of the same name from Cronenberg said he‚Äôs returning to his body horror roots for this one üëÄ.
*The synopsis details a future where humans have ‚Äúevolved beyond their natural state‚Äù and are able to alter their biological makeup. They adopt something called ‚ÄúAccelerated Evolution Syndrome,‚Äù which has been embraced by people like performance artist Saul Tenser (Mortensen) to grow new organs in his body‚Äîand he‚Äôs turned the removal of them into theater.*
The explicit theme of internal transformation is interesting given that it‚Äôs defined their last three films together.
Reactions

The element of organ removal elevated to exhibitive spectacle reminds me of another film of Cronenberg‚Äôs, *Dead Ringers.*

I wanna see  Cronenberg‚Äôs stack lol
I keep forgetting his entire latter half career. I was thinking of his stuff. But yeah you‚Äôre right Fly was a blockbuster
A lot of his work post videodrome is about exhibited spectacle/inhibited desire under mediated circumstances... and his movies take turns with his protagonist grappling with this internally and/or externally
I‚Äôve got to revisit his work after soon because it‚Äôs a blank spot in my studies of him
@JC_DENTUN JC what do you think of his run of like realist psychological films from history to dangerous method?

I feel like he started out loving the system he‚Äôs always been super pro cop and pro Justice-system
If anything the arc was more about learning to help and believe in people rather than just being feared by criminals
And I guess having hope in the possibility of change could be interpreted as loving the system, but I think it was more about like believing there are good people who want to do good
Yea fear isn‚Äôt as valuable as a tool as hope is or something cheesy like that
More of a sentimental thing than a political one imo

Chris Marker‚Äôs level is screening at metrograph  this week ‚Äî
*A woman (Laura), a computer, an invisible interlocutor: such is the setup on which LEVEL FIVE is built. She ‚Äúinherits‚Äù a task: to finish writing a video game centered on the Battle of Okinawa ‚Äì a tragedy practically unknown in the West, but whose development played a decisive role in the way World War II ended, as well as in postwar times and even our present.
A strange game, in fact. Contrary to classical strategy games whose purpose is to turn back the tide of history, this one seems willing only to reproduce history as it happened. While working on Okinawa and meeting through a rather unusual network ‚Äì parallel to Internet ‚Äì informants and even eye-witnesses to the battle (including film director Nagisa Oshima), Laura gathers pieces of the tragedy, until they start to interfere with her own life.
As in any self-respecting video game, this one proceeds by ‚Äúlevels‚Äù. Laura and her interlocutor, intoxicated by their enterprise, use this as a metaphor for life itself, and gladly attribute levels to everything around them. Will she attain LEVEL FIVE?*

‚ÄúIn information theory, the repetition of messages tends towards the obliteration of meaning. This theorem is vitally demonstrated in Extreme Animals‚Äô video Psychology Today, which traces the algorithmically accelerated decomposition of images from the post-millennial cultural imaginary: Shrek, the Joker, and other depressive icons of our interminable financial crisis inspire a legion of exhausted reenactments by children‚Äôs birthday party workers and freelance Blender artists. Interwoven with motivational programming staged at depreciating levels of conviction, the final assembly speaks not so much to the experience of overstimulation as to the unique combination of sensory hypertrophy and apathy characteristic of life
This is presentation is the first of a collaboration between Spectacle and the Queens-based art publisher Random Man Editions, which specializes in broadcasting various genres of the indescribable and documenting fringe practices across analogue and digital media. More information available at randomman.net.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt think they were particularly popular, even amongst millennials
Also, the last slide in this list features media that is far more representative of Zoomer culture than it is of millennial culture
Euphoria is not targeted towards a millennial audience, nor does it speak to the millennial experience
I agree that there‚Äôs a core list from mid - mid that probably held influence over majority millennials, however after the there are splits that a broad list can‚Äôt track.
Yeah, it‚Äôs nonsense
I feel like the soundtrack to that show alone is enough to say it is targeted to millennials, but I agree it doesn't speak to the experience.
I‚Äôm not at all aware of the soundtrack - any notable selections?
There's a lot of tracks from the bling hip hop era, that I don't think any zoomers have a relationship to.
However I say this as a capital M Millennial, so I may be wrong.
I think that show is trying to allow millennials who are desperately trying to maintain cultural relevance the opportunity to feel like they can understand and partake in zoomer culture.
Yeah there was some weird soundtrack stuff on euphoria where they are having parties and the soundtrack is rap music that would've been played at millenial high school parties

Without seeing the ending, I‚Äôm unsure how I feel about it. If it could stick the landing, it was a decent horror movie with a few interesting themes. Otherwise it was fun but lacked the edge I thought it would have. Honestly I thought it was going to be much gorier and scarier than it ended up being.
I spent most of the movie thinking about how contemporary movies that are period pieces in the actually take place during lol
Damn I‚Äôm sorry about the projector situation, that sucks. Yeah I feel this‚Äîwith X & licorice pizza I spent a lot of time thinking about whether the storylines would hold up as well without nostalgia in the equation. I was definitely entertained watching it but it did feel like something I had seen before, even with its own self awareness of how tropey the plot was (really seemed like a boogie nights x Texas chainsaw massacre mashup.) idk I did like it but it did really make me think about how few horror movies & movies in general take place in a contemporary landscape

except that the culture from the past is part of what makes your culture now, so a good idea to be familiar with perspectives that were experienced it first hand. and you wouldn't want to pigeonhole yourself as a mere cog in  marketing nomenclature, would you?
that said i thought the movie was somewhat over indulgent and i just couldn't get myself to care for it, because it was too insular. and as a teenager i did not experience anything remotely alike to what those ppl were doing.

Re: McCabe and mrs Miller - it‚Äôs one of those rare works where the period set was being constructed during filming, and was also tied into the narrative of a developing town on the frontier
The set builders are in period garb with period tools building in the background
Quite the production
Is that the one with the Leonard cohen soundtraxk
you have to sell part of your soul and make drastic compromises in your vision to get funding to produce something like that today
I doubt it would ever get made
it's so gorgeous and sad.  tht period in general was somewhat golden for cinema. outside of  the us you have nic roeg on fire...
The were definitely a landmark in large cinematic visions with aesthetic and narrative indulgences we rarely get today in the mainstream. Anyone with that impetus now is relegated to lower budgets usually and that obviously changes the film
Indeed!
one of my fav narratives on american failure is about how all of that came to implode. this book is a great, if nerdy, read:

I guess it brushes shoulders with ‚Äúindie sleaze‚Äù but it definitely felt more trust fund hipster gentrifier sleaze, and successful at that from what I recall. Only saw it once in If anyone is wondering it‚Äôs *not* a Tim&Eric film, Heidecker just stars.  Very dark film overall ‚Äî as someone who lived in nyc during this time and experienced a number of scenes I think it was articulating something that probably stung too many at the time it was made
Is it supposed to be a critical assessment of the remnants of that culture or is it supposed to be a retrospective criticism of the culture as a whole?
Critical assessment of remnants
Reactions
üëç
And it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôd call the entire hipster scene - it‚Äôs the wealthy contingent within, the north Williamsburg first wave condo dwellers (of that time)
Within the scene many were opposed to the displays of wealth as a somewhat misguided signifier of inauthenticity, (remnants of misdirected notions of ‚Äòselling out‚Äô back when that term was on life support before people stopped caring). it took a few more years for the inter-generational wealthy to come out as rich. In some ways the film anticipates this and is present in the detached sociopathic frictions that arise from Heidecker‚Äôs carelessness in traversing both nyc and it‚Äôs people

i‚Äôm thinking abt this film and some others shown in this series (ex. videodrome, hackers) (also titane comes up for some reason) as narratives which explore contemp anxiety abt technology‚Äôs relationship to the human, big thoughts hours
and like how this anxiety is always connected to the body, and to social reproduction (so to gender and sexuality) - we see this here, definitely in the other films i mention like titane (if in a different way)
Reactions
heart
I bet you this server has some connection to the director
I totally agree with that grouping of movies. I like to think of them as  oblique viewings of bodies in space. The relationship of technology is interwoven, but they all share a disassociation with the body. This lets these movies really negotiate some of the core human issues with identity, but I love how distinctly queer there viewpoints are. I don‚Äôt consider Cronenberg or even Titane to be definitely trans movie, but they give great views into what it means to truly negotiate with your body.

Possessor was interesting. Definitely thought provoking but it hasn‚Äôt stuck with me too much as time has gone on. Good but I honestly don‚Äôt remember much of it by this point
Titane was such an underrated film last year. I  think of the main character dancing on top of the fire truck in front of all the fire fighters every day

Same here, I mostly just remember how viscerally uncomfortable it made me.
that was one of my absolute favorites!
couldn't, can't stop thinking of it. often sing along to the soundtrack in my car. also the firemen bit reminds me a lot of this video:

idk. i watched the behind the scenes and seems to be a lot abt the women too. some pretty strong ones in the cast.

For sure.  first time I saw Anya Taylor joy on screen was the witch. Cool to see him work with her again. Loved the Witch but  never got around to watching lighthouse tho. feel like I missed the boat on that one and now whenever it comes up in my queue I always convince myself that I'm not in the right mood to watch it. is the hype real? Northman came on my radar pretty late. First time I saw the trailer was in theatres when I saw everything everywhere all at once a week or so ago. I had a marvel fanboy moment in the theatre during the clip of Skarsgard catching the spear and throwing it back lol.

It‚Äôs good
Very good
Love cronenberg but the book is superior to the film in my humble subjective opinion
very good book, probably the strongest of the ballard novels ive read
maybe its because i heard so much about crash before watching it but outside of the premise and some costumes the movie wasn't anything to write home about
(to be clear the premise _is_ something to write home about)
If you didn't like Crash, try Sonic the Hedgehog Another high-speed *sensual af* thriller by Cronenberg . Have heard very good things about it...

Not enjoying "I'm Thinking Of Ending Things"
 colleen
that movie is a nightmare
It's a thinly veiled commentary on aging and isolation posturing as an affecting examination of the processes inherent to decay
It's unnerving in a way that doesn't lend itself to pleasurable watching
ugh, I feel you on this. it is solipsistic drivel at its core. never been a fan of Kaufman though ‚Äì I file most of his films under 'sad immovable objects' I don't want living rent free in my mind.
Kaufman is low key gay
I didn‚Äôt like that movie that much
I liked ‚ÄúSynecdoche, New York‚Äù, but only because I could apply Baudrillard‚Äôs theory of simulacra to the film

Eternal Sunshine is funny and endearing
Of course, it‚Äôs also extremely sentimental and saccharine, but it‚Äôs re-watchable
Kaufman is just essential sadboycore

Adaptation is pretty good, classic nick cage role. Not his best but pretty good

It just reeks of pretension

bit of a weird request: I watched Scanners last night (not my favourite Cronenberg but some interesting stuff to chew re: multiple personalities, pharmaceutical vs. practice-based methods to control body and mind). There's a scene where a character holds flames in each of his upturned palms. I could swear that I've seen a Vitruvian Man style drawing/icon/symbol of a t-posed man, potentially headless, with flames in his upturned palms, but I cannot find evidence of it on the internet. Has anyone come across this symbol before?

also the context of contemplative spirituality is in the interior of the individual  and maybe sometimes the interior of a small collective. when that comes up against structures of society (esp ours) in the form of material systems things can get a little wacky lol‚Ä¶.

How would you compare it to the rest of No‚Äôs filmography? I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a big departure from his typical style of transgression.
So much different but to be fair I‚Äôve only seen the last one he made and enter the void!

Remind me at the end of the week. I‚Äôve quite a few films to catch in theaters this week üçø üé• üé≠
Did you guys find the acting  and writing in crimes of the future to be worse than a lot of his other stuff or just like, hyper stylized ? I‚Äôve only seen like two of his others so I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs kinda part of his thing or not
Cus I thought it was very purposeful but everyone else I saw it with thought it was just bad and me giving him too much self aware credit
didn't really resonate any different from his other movies to me. but also didn't think it was bad acting and the writing was meant to be somewhat funny.
saw dead ringers yesterday
Jeremy Irons killed that
Reactions
HELL YEA HE DID
my fav cronenberg
I enjoyed how stilted and weird k stew was
It was kinda hot
I loved the acting as well, especially Kristen Stewart‚Äôs performance, but I also felt like the writing wasn‚Äôt his best. The entire movie felt like exposition and right when the movie was picking up for me, it endedüôÅ
i was very down for the exposition
there's definitely some pretty stilted acting in it. k stew's performance is kind of bizarre, the repair people come off weird in every scene there in
and ive seen one of those actors before in things and she's a good actor lol
I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but if you‚Äôve seen Crash then.. just know there‚Äôs a third way for acting that is neither good nor bad just‚Äî- very Unusual
Love how in crash the actors are like weird props with desires rather than realistic people
Reactions

yeah i mean crony isnt really going for naturalistic
Ya
i agree the repair people's acting was off, seemed forced, kinda ruined those scenes a bit
I enjoyed it overall, but did anyone notice how the film quality at times was like so high it felt like you were on set, and the illusion of the film disappeared? That was the other thing that ruined some scenes for me. I don't know that much about film post-production...how do you fix that type of thing reduce the frame rate or add noise or was it just bad lighting?
Reactions

I don't watch tv that much but i noticed the same thing on some BBC tv series where the film quality was similarly bad...transparent

heart real
I have a lot to ponder, but I am here to say Crimes of the Future is a brilliant, prescient film.  Anyone who read xenofeminism should check it out.
Will see it a couple more times before I expand on my thoughts.  It dovetails nicely as a continuation of of the narrative and questions posed in Videodrome -> eXistenZ -> Cosmopolis -> Crimes of the Future.
Reactions
Incredibly juicy.  I haven‚Äôt left a film invigorated like this in some time
You‚Äôll have to elaborate as to why you believe that because I found the film to be extremely underwhelming and occasionally lacking in conviction and vision. This is not to say that it‚Äôs a bad film, it just didn‚Äôt strike me in the manner which I‚Äôd hoped it to
It‚Äôs so prescient my friend
As videodrome was
It‚Äôs the final nail in the simulacra coffin he started to build in videodrome
I understand the prescience and I found its awareness to occasionally be deeply unsettling, I just wish that the execution was as satisfying as Videodrome‚Äôs
Oh times change
He was a young man when he made that film
He didn‚Äôt even have the ending written until days before production completed
I think a younger person could have made this film and it would have just been boring overt repetitive anti-capitalist drivel hammering us in the head
Anyways I‚Äôm off for drinks to discuss, I‚Äôll circle back when I‚Äôve had some time to think
Reactions
üëç
Idk if any of his films are truly satisfying imo
I don‚Äôt mean to extend the conversation any longer than it‚Äôs gone on but I‚Äôd agree, I‚Äôm happy that a young person didn‚Äôt produce the film and I‚Äôve significant doubts as to whether they‚Äôd even be capable of doing so
Guys it‚Äôs not really about being satisfied - it‚Äôs art
Marvel movies satisfy - they entertain
Cronenberg pushes themes that are deeply personal that happen to be concerned with the near future of humankind
Reactions
Butter my ass and call me a funko pop
Reactions
üëÜ
I guess I‚Äôm a marvel boy
But I find his movies to have very dope premises that I always want him to expand upon
I think part of my dissatisfaction was that I dragged my ex and her friend to see it with me and they left disappointed
So that‚Äôs completely irrelevant to the actual thematic content of the film
Lol
They expand in your life
The expansion is here, now
That‚Äôs the idea
He opens the door
I got shitfaced watching it and can‚Äôt really recall the second half
Absolutely
What did that guy say in the movie?
‚ÄúI am a mechanic who builds doors and windows into the future‚Äù
Reactions
I think I just have world of Warcraft brain damage where I want like a whole worldbuilding lore thing to go with
We already live in the worlds he expresses - you are participating in the world building now
Reactions
What about this world had made humans resistant to pain? What material conditions exist that have people eating plastic and growing new parts? What happened
It‚Äôs implied that it‚Äôs humanity evolving
All of it is evolution
And the fear is that evolution is chaos, when it‚Äôs simply a system of order that we don‚Äôt understand, let alone control
It‚Äôs all there
Nothing is missing
I found the scenes featuring performance art to be both the most unsettling and most fascinating aspects of the film
I greatly appreciated those
Lots of excellent societal critique there
It‚Äôs better that it‚Äôs implied and the viewer imagines those pieces - it‚Äôs the subjective spaces that make films like this good. It‚Äôs an exploration of an idea, not a world
Of a NOW that we are within
And one  way to extrapolate meaning from  now is to set it in another time, another place - the distance allows for better analysis
Reactions
real
Yeah the art world critique was just bonus surface level humor
Reactions
üëÜ
I guess I just am more into explorations of world a la high fantasy shit
Sounds like you appreciate literalism
Now I‚Äôm not knocking the movie I enjoy cronenberg
No stones left unturned
Yeah
That‚Äôs cool
Derek‚Äôs making want to re-watch the film just so that I can attempt to study it in greater detail, especially the dialogue
I think I need to rewatch it clearheaded
I watched scanners last week again and really appreciated that the ending felt like a whole world was introduced
A new playing field
A whole other movie was about to start
I love that
That‚Äôs how I felt about existenz and the brood and I wanted moooooooore
Reactions
üëÜ
And then the movie ends.
Existenz literally implies that they never left the simulation
That they are lost within it
The escape is not possible nor should it be desirable
The simulacara is relative
Yeah I guess that‚Äôs one thing I really enjoy about him cus he‚Äôs also able to do it without creating this cliff hanger affect, it‚Äôs like just showing us that these characters exist in their universe beyond the scope of the movie
So yeah it ends and suddenly there‚Äôs more movie there
And the brood is an early imperfect film so ya know it‚Äôs a solid early feature for what it is
Same with shivers
Cronenberg is clearly working something out with his films because they boil down to the same themes explored in different spaces
Reminds me a lot of Hesse in that sense
The brood has this underlying theme of cults and new age self help and the dangers of that but it‚Äôs always just kinda there and never expanded upon and I want him to go in!!! He never does tho
Life rarely does
Sometimes you just enter into an entire prefabricated world that you never get the gist of
No mastery
Yeah but it‚Äôs a movie where a director has control over everything fabricated and made and shown in a world
Actually the brood was a documentary
That‚Äôs why I love loving here - I enter into entire universes that should not exist but almost always have and will
They aren‚Äôt for me to know unless I want to dedicate my life to them
But I can‚Äôt, so all I have are my impressions of moving through those universes during a fixed moment in space time
I get where you‚Äôre coming from here and I think I just disagree bc I play dnd and want to know everything about everything
Reactions
real
In the lore/worldbuilding kind of way
Does he? Or is he using mythopoetic narratives to express something that was already happening in the real world at that time
*The Odyssey* isn‚Äôt a documentary, however the mythic aspects are a better way to experience the true perceptions of a time in order to digest a more wholistic  paradigm than simply reading facts and assumptions of facts in a dry PHD dissertation
Cronenberg should write a ttrpg that takes place in his cinematic universe then ill be happy ig
You can write it
Others have I think
Do you think that Cronenberg aims to convey caution or hesitance to his audience regarding the societal developments he‚Äôs examining or is he merely conveying their continued development through his work? Do you think his work has an overt moral character or is he content to be a bystander whose more so interested in examining a variety of possible ramifications that might arise from the continuation of such developments?
He conveys what is
Sorry, long question, but it‚Äôs worth considering
He shows both the caution and those that through themselves in
‚ÄúI create windows and doors into the future‚Ä¶ politics come later‚Äù
That is very, very true of today
Of all time
I couldn‚Äôt agree more
He‚Äôs a conduit
He lays it out
You can be the judge
Could you rephrase this
Simpler
I‚Äôm retarded
Tattooing the organs is clearly about capital
About pulling king tut‚Äôs tomb out of a pyramid burial chamber and throwing it into a museum. About stripping if of its meaning that we can never truly understand, because we do not have the proper paradigms of lived experience of that period.
Throwing it into the white box museum strips it of its original meaning. The amorphous shape of capitalism absorbs the unknown into its lexicon, only to alphabetize and catalogue it, and then become a rigid box yet again, once the difference is resolved
Something about the tat organs and the organ beareau reminded me of all the abortion legislation that‚Äôs going on now
Hence the vulgarity in seeing American traditional tattoos always already on the organs of something that was supposed to be new, and paradigm shattering
Instead the vulgarity of the system has already destroyed the difference, the new paradigm, as the system conspires to maintain itself
Reactions
üëÜ
It‚Äôs all so clear to me, I feel uniquely primed to appreciate this film
Ballard and Cronenberg were huge parts of my youth and subsequent development
I thought a significant amount about how we‚Äôve resorted to the modification of our appearance (forced aesthetic evolution of our bodies) as a means of attempting to re-assert some degree of autonomy or idiosyncratic character, despite Capitalism‚Äôs homogenizing tendencies
Exactly
There are already fetish clubs that perform surgeries in a similar fashion
It is a thing already
And this theme of where to take the transgressive behaviors has been a question for centuries
What happens when violence to an other is no longer enough?
What happens when Sex and drugs become meaningless to the addict?
Reactions
What is next within a system comprised of desiring machines?  Of people that see themselves as living desires?
Reactions
üëÜ
I need to talk to Cronenberg before he dies
Get him on pm
I will ask around
We‚Äôre probably link removed from each other
This kind of thinking is endlessly fascinating for me
That‚Äôs why I found the scenes featuring dissection and mutilation so hard to stomach - I had to avert my eyes numerous times because I felt as if I grasped the enormity of the repercussions of such actions
Damn I ate a bag of popcorn

Maybe I‚Äôve just read and watched way too much extreme and atypical libidinal stuff
It was just an aesthetic for me
An archetypal language of fleshy symbols that harkens back to his earlier films
I was thinking that the implants in his partners head reminded me of Hecate. A representation of the unconscious desire to adapt literally bursting through (her skull) into consciousness.
Attachments

It‚Äôs not as if I hadn‚Äôt been exposed to similar content, it was just more so that the various acts performed in the film seemed to have been normalized to a degree I found intolerable
I really don‚Äôt like the idea of transcending humanity‚Äôs seemingly innate limitations
I find myself sympathizing with Nietzsche in that regard
Remember - it‚Äôs about the survival of those who adapt, not those that are fit.  Darwin never said the latter
Eat the damn trash can
Reactions
real
Humanity is and is not choosing
Humanity is adapting to its environment
It‚Äôs implied that it‚Äôs a willful adaptation on an unconscious level
But more consciously we still fight it because of an actual unnatural conception of humanity that we are clinging too and foolishly mistaking as natural.  Do we submit to a force greater than us?  Do we fight it?
You always already have been and always will
It was mostly digital
It‚Äôs hard to reconcile the two
Right
That‚Äôs why we die
Reactions
real
Because we can‚Äôt
I‚Äôve fully accepted the trashcan
And another generation can
You literally don‚Äôt have to - just die
I know I‚Äôm infertile I can just sense it
Cronenberg often has some shadowy corporate or state agency attempting to control or suppress narratives of progress
Reactions
Another classic and solid theme of his
Hell viggo played the same guy in eastern promises
I see a lot of cronenberg‚Äôs career coming together here
And I expect his next film to be a climax of sorts
For whatever reason, this conversation has made me slightly more comfortable with my current existence and its intrinsic futility than I did maybe even as recently as minutes ago
Reactions

Loved the sub plot of bureaucratic nobodies horseshoeing themselves into fetishizing the thing they are paid to keep in line

They were a welcome addition
Yeah and the light hearted behavior around the murdering
Very Peter Greenaway in that respect
Skipping down the stairs after drilling some guy in the head
And of course
Viggo as an extension of his art is literally helping a CIA like agency keep others in line
Sounds a lot like AbEx
He hates his body so much that he literally calls the FEDs on anyone who enjoys their body lmao
All of which is apart of his praxis

The new ‚Äúfilmmaker mode‚Äù setting is also being championed by Martin Scorsese, Patty Jenkins, Ryan Coogler, and more.
I've said this other places but if existenz shows us what media does to the body, crimes of the future shows us what the body becomes _after_ media.
There are (almost) no screens or billboards or books in this world, and they certainly aren't functionally equivalent to how they're used now: to activate our pleasure centers into _consuming_ more..
The darkest part for me was this: all of these  systems of domination & control that exist now, exist in crimes of the world future. The difference being that in this future cronenberg envisions, the mediating effect of visual media is no longer needed because these systems of control have been fully _internalized_. Even capitals tendency to accelerate has wormed its way into our bodies through the production of new organs. (Also interesting to note there are no modern forms of transport, save a few beached container ships in the background of a few scenes)

Hi - new to the chat. I really appreciate your analysis. Love the Xenofeminism connection as a Feminist Science and Tech Studies researcher. My analytical faculties were unfortunately subdued during my viewing in theaters - after a vasovagal response took over (the facial cutting performance got me).

I had to sit outside the theater blinded by dizziness and nausea, repeating to myself ‚Äúplease stay here, please stay here.‚Äù I stumbled into the AMC bathroom and collapsed on the ground after yelling ‚Äúhelp!‚Äù No one came. I vomited, felt a lot better, and returned to my seat to finish the movie. I went to see the film alone and was the only person in the theater during a matinee.

also yeah i feel about the same. it was interesting and i liked the vibe but i'm not sure if i'd rewatch it
if i had to frame what the movie was saying it would be like: whether physically (Karen) or metaphorically (Elise), capital will find a way to screw you no matter what, and in rare cases it will end up being both (in the case of Diane)
That seems about right. I also think there are a few interesting themes: desensitization via digital content, the way globalized capitalism distributes agency for cruelty and violence. It reminded me of in that you‚Äôre witnessing terrible things and slowly connecting them to mostly banal actions taken across the world.

one of my fav cult movies. i've rewatched it a few times since i saw it upon its release.but that is the problem with any movie addressing technology: it dates fast. think of how old this movie is.
i love the super look. it aligns with what was going on visually then with many directors shooting features digitally. my fav. ones are by soderbherg and  figgis.

‚ÄúYou have to deal with your own repulsion-fascination with the modern world. You can‚Äôt escape this unless you are some kind of Jansenist monk,‚Äù Olivier Assayas expounded to Reverse Shot in upon the release of his international sleaze-thriller Boarding Gate.

When Isle of Dogs first premiered I watched it at a very old cinema palace and I was absurdly high on mushrooms for the duration of the movie and at one point convinced myself that it was a dramatic/fictional retelling of a true story and I ended up vomiting after the movie ended due to the relief that I did not in fact exist in the same universe as‚Ä¶ whatever the fuck message that film was trying to convey.
Animation dept. was top tier tho ngl
I‚Äôd say it was cast well, disappointed with the casting for Lady Jessica and Gaius Helen Mohiam

I can‚Äôt believe this, I was writing a post to ask if we could screen hard to be a god ‚Ä¶ I saw the premiere at anthology years ago and always wanted to.  I‚Äôm not sure if I can make the stream tonight but I‚Äôll try.
Imagine being a group of anthropologists and scientists traveling to witness another culture‚Äôs renaissance ‚Ä¶ only to experience a perpetual dark age ‚Ä¶
@FlipKostic I have to ask what made you think of this?  I was going to suggest it as another slow feature akin to Tarkovsky, with themes closer to the cell‚Äôs interests.
@Umberto Ecco I‚Äôve definitely mentioned this to you in passing a few times. You should tune if you have the time tonight.
i saw tarkovsky and thought what other movies was i watching when i watched the bulk of tarkovsky and hard to be a god was one of them

Anyone else noticing a recent uptick of Hollywood blockbusters that fundamentally obscure the CIA‚Äôs various historical MKULTRA programs?  Given that events like the CIA‚Äôs orchestration of Jonestown are now popular Twitter conspiracy fodder, the timing of this movie is interesting.  Tarantino‚Äôs last film is another example; it overshadowed Tom O‚ÄôNeil‚Äôs *Chaos* book as it was making waves in firmly connecting Manson to the CIA.

Well the CIA‚Äôs Hollywood department is quite active and public, however I‚Äôm getting at this trend of biopics that ostensibly place themselves as the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù account, or are so phantasmagorical that their simplistic fiction is desired more than any real comprehension of historical events whose hidden mechanisms reach into the present.  There are definitely hype cycles to these things and figures like this will continue to be resurrected with each generation.  I just know the reality of the Jonestown programming camp is trending in our circles, making a larger impact than it historically has when discussed.  The spectacle of these biopics seems to intensify, as if in response.

havent seen it since high school
Absolutely, certainly should be screened here. I think Stalker would be a great Tarkovsky starting point for the cell. The dilemma posed by the room at the center of the zone concerns the realization of the unconscious desires of the three characters whose representative archetypes I feel are quite relevent here and to the modern day. The exploration of Aristotelian unity is relevant as well (location, action, and time).

I watched the new james bond my take away was
the opening sequence where a bunch of guns spiral in a double helix and then shoot bullets to create a stream which connects each gun node to the other side of the helix was incredible and i'd like to recreate it for an artwork
I would like to be hired to make the opening sequence for a bond movie but realize that they are basically committing suicide with the franchise after this film
Ana de Armas is beautiful and I love her, my new celebrity crush
The movie was like an hour too long and pretty boring
it gets bags of popcorn and a soda pop from me because i enjoyed some of it if you let yourself just take in the bond formula, but it drags on long enough that you get tired of it

Hunger is good, Wind that Shakes the Barley is good

Wind that shakes the Barley focusing on the sort of beginnings of the formation of the organised IRA, and Hunger is much more recent, and about my mother‚Äôs famous neighbour lol
In the name of the father is also great, about innocent men wrongly imprisoned under the terrorism act of Britain, less of a focus on the IRA and more of a focus on the corruption of the British government
There‚Äôs also quite a lot on The Troubles in general
ah yes the least photogenic political martyr of all time, mr sands
Hahaha my mum said he was hot!!!!
Wind that shakes the barley is a fuckin banger
Great illustration of why you shouldn‚Äôt interrupt a couple dudes playing hurling

Michael collins is a good movie and it does accurately depict how much of an asshole my namesake was
Snape as Dev, inspired casting

and they just make more bad formal work afterwards
like the film makers/vfx house didn't understand what we liked about the look of the original matrix movies

Mainstream caters to the lowest common denominator and the most sellable tropes. It always looks like shit, appreciate whatever you can from it or just look elsewhere know what I mean?  There are so many great pieces of historical media that speak better to now, than most stuff that gets pushed to the surface today.  Anything new that does encapsulate some element of the zeitgeist today often doesn‚Äôt have the budget or connections to be impactful or visible. I know that all sounds obvious but it is what it is
I was up last night watching this Abel Ferrara executive produced comedy about an NYC techno store going under in The owner Keith is a down and out trance DJ who is struggling to cope with the changing cultural climate, so he organizes a rave in a final effort to save the store. Felt incredibly relevant to today. Low budget but doesn‚Äôt look like shit, its raw unpolished aesthetic lends to the authenticity of the story.

We can talk about it in VC sometime if you‚Äôd like. I know there are some other opinions on where to start with Tarkovsky but I think viewing the any of his films (I‚Äôd start with stalker, it was my introduction) followed by a discussion on a following day to allow time for digestion would be great.  Personally find his work more relevant to my life with each passing year.
Whether you are considering it from Bergson or Deleuze‚Äôs perspective, the core concept is that lived time, time that endures, is time that flows, time in which the past and future penetrate into the present in the form of memory and desire.
Reactions
heart
Consider experiences in your life in which time stretches when it seems to move more slowly (ie: when bored), and compacts during moments of crisis, while we seem to dip deeper into memory at some points (ie: moments of dreaming, fantasy, reverie), and more shallowly during moments of action.

‚ù§Ô∏è
Referencing my copies of Cinema to better answer your question - There are films in which we see mirrorings of various sorts. Mirrors provide us with virtual images of actual entities. A person seeing their actual face in the mirror sees a virtual image of their face. What is the temporal status of their face? It seems as if the time of the mirror exists in a perpetual past-future, or future-past of the present of the actual image it reflects (ie: what exactly are you looking at?) This is where the notion of the mirror image comes from.
Mirrors are also people, from a more Lacanian standpoint similar two characters in a film that resemble each other are a mirror.
If time is marked by clocks, it‚Äôs by using physical difference in the world around us to mark degrees of change in space. (Space is separated from time in this metaphor; space demarcates time).
So, what happens when Mirrors are encountered in film (or life for that matter)?  They disrupt one‚Äôs  linear perception or flow or time.  What happens when space starts to resemble itself (with more mirrors)?  What happens when we encounter a hallway of mirrors, aka the crystal?  Linearity is disrupted and our notions of before and after break down.
Why does this matter?
One thing you learn watching image crystals is to suspend your judgment of images, because you will never know which aspect of an image will be selected for radical reworking later in the film. In this manner, each image becomes suffused with past/future, time, context, relation, and difference. It becomes virtual, less directly present, pure difference lurks between the very pores of the aspects of the image. What is present is an imaging of time, a depiction of time, of pure difference, in the image itself.
A direct imaging of time.

I think metahaven may have actually plotted this out on an x,y,z axis graph for clarity.  If not I‚Äôm going to do it

I‚Äôve never once conceived of mirrors as a destabilizing force that disrupts the tenuous linearity we construct to ensure that we can function as humans
Reactions
eyesglow
I think that people in are experiencing a rapidly accelerating amount of mirrors in their lives that create unintelligible complex prisms beyond comprehension.  With the free flow of infinite information, along with exposure to specific viewpoints creating ever more polarized experiences, the desire for linearity, non-mirrored, entertainment increases.
Reactions
I think this is a recursive pattern across time that signifies a great paradigm shift that eventually will be a common mode of understanding.  We seem to return to mirrorless linearity across history, but I often wonder if we will enter into a zone of comprehension in which time prisms are the norm of experiences.  If linear time is simply a mental construct, then a more real experience should be that of the hallway of mirrors.
Reactions
Eh try not to think about it and enjoy the film lol.  The characters are wonderful and the dilemma presented by the room at the heart of the zone, to me, is the dilemma of our time.
Tarkovsky‚Äôs balance of diagetic and non-diagetic sounds are mirrors of their own ‚ù§Ô∏è
Reactions
heart
do you feel your analysis is evident in the film itself? I started my academic curiosities as a film reviewer in high school and pursued film studies but found it to be complete incoherent garbage totally disconnected with my life ‚Äî and sometimes from the artist's own intent. There's a semi-famous story of an examination of the Frankenstein and its usage of black frames interspersed throughout the movie. I don't have the link to the actual article but it was called a compelling critique and the director came out and said "yeah we just screwed up putting together the final reel so there's missing frames that are black."
I'm very eager for a deeper connection to art, but I've been disappointed at some critical analysis bringing things to the art that's not there at all.
I‚Äôm curious if you think there‚Äôs space at all for bringing something outside the artists intent to the work. If the response/critical analysis is incoherent that‚Äôs an issue, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything inherently wrong with using contextual information outside the work to analyze it
Reactions
stancestrong
yeah I do agree there can often be analysis beyond the artist's intent. I think I subscribe to death of an author.
like did Verhoeven intend for Basic Instinct to be integral to sexual freedom and spotlighting bisexual characters? almost certainly not
I stated my understanding of Time Crystals, and tried to illustrate it beyond the dimension of film for clarity‚Äôs sake.  Images are never just images for Deleuze but if they are for you, I respect that.
Time *is* a purely mental construct, and linear perception is a result of how we structure the external world and our relationship to it.  The virtual is not merely the past, and memory, but also the future, and fantasy. I believe that access to the virtual is essential to human existence, and that the linear experience of external events in our daily lives can vastly limit our access to the virtual
I have no entry to Deleuze and if you intuit I have a position in relation to his view it is an unexamined one. I don't think I'm lost in what you've shared so far I'm just reminded of this XKCD

However Tarkovsky wrote extensively about his conceptions of time, and his intentions do align with a deleuzian or bergsonian analysis
I was giving an example to @idols.ico 's point that there can be critique that exists outside of artist's intent that is worthwhile. I think they were saying ‚Äî in response to my question on if your insight is present in the art ‚Äî that it doesn't have to be to be worthwhile.
Reactions
‚ù§Ô∏è
Gotcha!  That all being said, the analysis is definitely not why I like his movies. It‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve come to understand and agree with.  I do feel that time crystals, or disruptions in one‚Äôs linear perception of time really do allow for judgement and bias to be dispensed with, and a potential for openness to difference.  That‚Äôs huge.

I tend to appreciate artists in any medium who create these timeless, or perhaps detached virtual spaces. I see unlimited potential in those moments that are essential and frankly I‚Äôm sure most people do as well, even if not in those terms.

We shouldn‚Äôt let us be captured by schematizing machines

Do you believe that there‚Äôs a way by which to preserve certain aspects of industrial society while discarding of schematizing systems and/or constructs? I think of Zerzan‚Äôs writing on agriculture when attempting to confront the tyranny of the clock upon the foundations of human society, but that necessarily precludes any attempt at preserving the benefits of technological advancement
Oof tough, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way back, our minds and body and too shaped by it now to even comprehend living beyond it, except in like art, film, meditation, and drug circumstances.
I gotta read more zerzan
Reactions
doubt
But in some regard there‚Äôs always been a historic sense of organizing time
It‚Äôs just how absolute is it now
Despite a strong affection for theorists who are advocates of the liberatory potential of technology, my anti-tech sentiments inform much of my thinking regarding the deconstruction of entrenched behaviors and associated structures
Would you say that was even true in pre-agricultural societies? You can argue that time was far less regimented and specific behaviors were based upon reoccurring events (namely migratory patterns and the change of seasons) but such a conception of time stands in contrast to the conception that emerged from agricultural society
I kept this in mind throughout the entirety of the film and I found the manner by which Tarkovsky subtly manipulates the definition of a diagetic sound within the film to be a phenomenal - there are numerous instances where certain sounds are first made apparent to the viewer before the characters are made aware of it, alongside instances where it‚Äôs nearly impossible to discern if the characters can hear what exactly the audience is hearing
Reactions
ü§ç
That‚Äôs the beauty of the concepts like mirror hallways and time crystals.  I think what you‚Äôre describing affects the viewer‚Äôs perception of time with or without their knowledge of such.  That‚Äôs good filmmaking IMO. Tarkovsky masterfully lulls the viewer into virtual spaces, (or zones in the language of the film). Stalker is crafted in a way where I think numerous meaning can be inferred from our experience in the zone (of both the film experience itself and the location within).  It‚Äôs been a while but from what I recall he sees his viewers in the camp of the rational atheist skeptic, the spiritual believer (Christ consciousness), and the supernatural believer.  Each viewer can leave the film with a potent experience of meaning, even if they don‚Äôt share Tarkovsky‚Äôs own view of the world.
Reactions
heart
I‚Äôm in complete agreement, as those distinct sentiments and perspectives are present in each of the three characters or that each reflects a distinct perspective towards an entity such as the Zone
Awesome.  You‚Äôll find the same concepts across all of his films. Andrei Rublev really highlights these notions.
There also appears to exist a conflict between actions dictated by pure emotion and pure reason, whose consequences lead to meditation upon the circumstantial value of each sensation
Yeah.  The skeptical scientist (STEM), the famous cynical writer with writers block (liberal arts, humanities) and the stalker (persecuted christ, perhaps to a fault) all are at odds in how to resolve the question of the room.
Imagine being on the precipice of your inner most desire, only to know that you can never be certain of your truest desire.  Is our non-integrated shadow our truest expression?  The movie is intended to awaken the viewer to the knowledge that the terrain beyond their conscious mind is largely closed to them, and that it is there where their deepest desire smolders.  How can you ever be confident on what exactly is your deepest desire?

dang reading this made me like the film even more nice
I think the idea that *intelligence may be the ability to harness the powers of the surrounding world, without destroying it* is a profound concept to consider ‚Ä¶
Yeah it‚Äôs a haunting thought. I empathize tremendously with the characters and sometimes I think Tarkovsky was able to do a better job of what Hesse was attempting to do repeatedly with his novels, as they have similar character dilemmas at play.
Sorry I didn‚Äôt respond to the stuff above
But I wanted to respond here and say they‚Äôre both great but tarkovsky has the benefit of the dimension of space that film captures that writing can‚Äôt or I guess some poets grapple with that but Hesse doesn‚Äôt
The characters in stalker are moving as we move through a space neither of us have an understanding of, maybe it‚Äôs the brain itself the space of imagining, but we‚Äôre embodying it through the process of viewing

succession is as fun as the "expression" in dasha's eyes. good writing, but... also puzzled by the costumes and some of the interiors. you want to watch horrible ppl, there is much better out there to pick from.
What‚Äôs your favourite horrible ppl media?
@idols.ico let's see, going way back chorderlos de laclos' "dangerous liaisons". seinfeld was good, the grifters, the last temptation, romeo is bleeding, chinatown, body heat, borgman, funny games, in the company of men...
I think succession has great writing great acting and overall pretty well paced

The director of ‚ÄúLicorice Pizza‚Äù discusses his writing process, choosing actors, and how you can tell when you are on a good film set.
PTA had an interesting take - pretty much that maybe superhero movies can be a good life raft to keep the industry alive; as long as the category of ‚Äògoing to movies‚Äô still makes sense, there will be money kicking around for other, riskier shit to be made

I don‚Äôt think propaganda films such as the marvel movies have any relevance to art nowadays; maybe in the past such films were influential works,  but with the democratization of art I think these films can be completely ignored in a discussion of art or film

Yep.  I‚Äôd add that rarely are trilogies crafted across stretches of time, let alone decades in such a considered manner.  The kernel of the initial idea is explored as it unfolds across both lived and cinematic time, as opposed to the more typical trend of three films conceived and executed in relative succession.
Reactions
I just realized those three movies are the same director
Cronenberg been working forever
I think I‚Äôm the only person who enjoyed his performance in The Rover.  It was actually the first film I saw starring Pattinson.  I recall going to the theater to see something else that was sold out, so I wandered into an empty theater to see the other film playing, which happened to be The Rover.  I found him compelling in the role.
Certainly a flawed film, however the long soundless stretches of driving across barren desert with the basinski score was moving

Putting cosmopolis on the list after reading the chat
I think his most mainstream films are probably The Fly, Eastern Promises and A History of Violence.  Viggo Moretensen and Cronenberg are actually working together again for a new film, titled *Crimes of the Future.* (not a remake of his film of the same name from Cronenberg said he‚Äôs returning to his body horror roots for this one üëÄ.
*The synopsis details a future where humans have ‚Äúevolved beyond their natural state‚Äù and are able to alter their biological makeup. They adopt something called ‚ÄúAccelerated Evolution Syndrome,‚Äù which has been embraced by people like performance artist Saul Tenser (Mortensen) to grow new organs in his body‚Äîand he‚Äôs turned the removal of them into theater.*
The explicit theme of internal transformation is interesting given that it‚Äôs defined their last three films together.

The element of organ removal elevated to exhibitive spectacle reminds me of another film of Cronenberg‚Äôs, *Dead Ringers.*

I keep forgetting his entire latter half career. I was thinking of his stuff. But yeah you‚Äôre right Fly was a blockbuster
A lot of his work post videodrome is about exhibited spectacle/inhibited desire under mediated circumstances... and his movies take turns with his protagonist grappling with this internally and/or externally
I‚Äôve got to revisit his work after soon because it‚Äôs a blank spot in my studies of him

||like every sequel/reboot/revival is a pull between what fans expect and what the creator wants, and the movie was very clear about "i don't want to make this fucking movie and you probably don't want me too either." By putting that issue on the main character everyone likes, it allowed for the movie to be a lot more human about the whoring out of a beloved film for a cinematic universe. All that said, the action stuff is bad and it's attempt to be a proper sequel on top of trolling everyone didn't really work. Still, it was novel and interesting||

There were flashes of visual brilliance that reminded me of what was so amazing about the movie, but not enough for me really. Really missed Yuen Woo-Ping as choreographer - despite some impressive camera moments, the action stuff was really sub-par in this one

Dj Vu All over Again | John Semley
Our culture is glitching, looping, stuck in some long, static interregnum. So is ‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections.‚Äù
> Especially because the original Matrix, as imagined by sororal duo Lilly and Lana Wachowski, felt genuinely inventive. It blended Terminator-styled dystopian sci-fi with Hong Kong wire-fu action and state-of-the-art special effects, all draped in the industrial liveries of a turn-of-the-millennium goth club. It may not have been wholly new. But it was thrilling remix. It spoke to the ennui of America at the ‚Äúend of history.‚Äù It captured the soul-deadening, Dilbert-esque daily doldrums explored in films like Fight Club and Office Space. It also played straight to the anxiety around and the mounting cultural panic that home computers and toaster ovens might break down or turn against their owners. The Matrix felt like it was speaking to its time. Now, movies seem to chatter only among themselves.

I never wanted to see a film where I felt like the director was being held at gun point by a cartoonishly large bag of cash, and yet, I watched The Matrix Resurrections anyways.  That‚Äôs my review.
Reactions

The director quote about using the film as a step out of depression after the death of their parents, and having to be haggled by the cast to finish shooting during COVID signaled to me that it in aggregate, it was probably more fun to make than it would be to watch (pass)
I came up with at least compelling sequels that would have been better while watching the movie.  I really can‚Äôt believe how it ended, just such a lazy mess.

hey probs been asked a times but does anyone know where you can watch Arguing The World for free?
Do you guys think the shot-by-shot stuff at the start intentionally looks worse then the original (would sort of make sense in the context of the story) or does it just show the decline in film making standards from the
Hard to say, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intentional. That gives the director too much credit.  It was more disappointing than anything else.  Even if we had to keep the story there are so many better ways to shoot it. I assume wachowski‚Äôs hands were partly tied to mediocre concepts. If not, then shame on them.

Anyone else noticing a recent uptick of Hollywood blockbusters that fundamentally obscure the CIA‚Äôs various historical MKULTRA programs?  Given that events like the CIA‚Äôs orchestration of Jonestown are now popular Twitter conspiracy fodder, the timing of this movie is interesting.  Tarantino‚Äôs last film is another example; it overshadowed Tom O‚ÄôNeil‚Äôs *Chaos* book as it was making waves in firmly connecting Manson to the CIA.

Well the CIA‚Äôs Hollywood department is quite active and public, however I‚Äôm getting at this trend of biopics that ostensibly place themselves as the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù account, or are so phantasmagorical that their simplistic fiction is desired more than any real comprehension of historical events whose hidden mechanisms reach into the present.  There are definitely hype cycles to these things and figures like this will continue to be resurrected with each generation.  I just know the reality of the Jonestown programming camp is trending in our circles, making a larger impact than it historically has when discussed.  The spectacle of these biopics seems to intensify, as if in response.

havent seen it since high school
Absolutely, certainly should be screened here. I think Stalker would be a great Tarkovsky starting point for the cell. The dilemma posed by the room at the center of the zone concerns the realization of the unconscious desires of the three characters whose representative archetypes I feel are quite relevent here and to the modern day. The exploration of Aristotelian unity is relevant as well (location, action, and time).

I watched the new james bond my take away was
the opening sequence where a bunch of guns spiral in a double helix and then shoot bullets to create a stream which connects each gun node to the other side of the helix was incredible and i'd like to recreate it for an artwork
I would like to be hired to make the opening sequence for a bond movie but realize that they are basically committing suicide with the franchise after this film
Ana de Armas is beautiful and I love her, my new celebrity crush
The movie was like an hour too long and pretty boring
it gets bags of popcorn and a soda pop from me because i enjoyed some of it if you let yourself just take in the bond formula, but it drags on long enough that you get tired of it

Hunger is good, Wind that Shakes the Barley is good
Reactions
Wind that shakes the Barley focusing on the sort of beginnings of the formation of the organised IRA, and Hunger is much more recent, and about my mother‚Äôs famous neighbour lol
In the name of the father is also great, about innocent men wrongly imprisoned under the terrorism act of Britain, less of a focus on the IRA and more of a focus on the corruption of the British government
There‚Äôs also quite a lot on The Troubles in general
ah yes the least photogenic political martyr of all time, mr sands
Hahaha my mum said he was hot!!!!
Wind that shakes the barley is a fuckin banger
Great illustration of why you shouldn‚Äôt interrupt a couple dudes playing hurling

Michael collins is a good movie and it does accurately depict how much of an asshole my namesake was
Snape as Dev, inspired casting
I‚Äôll ask my da can‚Äôt remember the name

and they just make more bad formal work afterwards
like the film makers/vfx house didn't understand what we liked about the look of the original matrix movies

Mainstream caters to the lowest common denominator and the most sellable tropes. It always looks like shit, appreciate whatever you can from it or just look elsewhere know what I mean?  There are so many great pieces of historical media that speak better to now, than most stuff that gets pushed to the surface today.  Anything new that does encapsulate some element of the zeitgeist today often doesn‚Äôt have the budget or connections to be impactful or visible. I know that all sounds obvious but it is what it is
I was up last night watching this Abel Ferrara executive produced comedy about an NYC techno store going under in The owner Keith is a down and out trance DJ who is struggling to cope with the changing cultural climate, so he organizes a rave in a final effort to save the store. Felt incredibly relevant to today. Low budget but doesn‚Äôt look like shit, its raw unpolished aesthetic lends to the authenticity of the story.

We can talk about it in VC sometime if you‚Äôd like. I know there are some other opinions on where to start with Tarkovsky but I think viewing the any of his films (I‚Äôd start with stalker, it was my introduction) followed by a discussion on a following day to allow time for digestion would be great.  Personally find his work more relevant to my life with each passing year.
Whether you are considering it from Bergson or Deleuze‚Äôs perspective, the core concept is that lived time, time that endures, is time that flows, time in which the past and future penetrate into the present in the form of memory and desire.
Reactions
heart
Consider experiences in your life in which time stretches when it seems to move more slowly (ie: when bored), and compacts during moments of crisis, while we seem to dip deeper into memory at some points (ie: moments of dreaming, fantasy, reverie), and more shallowly during moments of action.

‚ù§Ô∏è
Referencing my copies of Cinema to better answer your question - There are films in which we see mirrorings of various sorts. Mirrors provide us with virtual images of actual entities. A person seeing their actual face in the mirror sees a virtual image of their face. What is the temporal status of their face? It seems as if the time of the mirror exists in a perpetual past-future, or future-past of the present of the actual image it reflects (ie: what exactly are you looking at?) This is where the notion of the mirror image comes from.
Mirrors are also people, from a more Lacanian standpoint similar two characters in a film that resemble each other are a mirror.
If time is marked by clocks, it‚Äôs by using physical difference in the world around us to mark degrees of change in space. (Space is separated from time in this metaphor; space demarcates time).
So, what happens when Mirrors are encountered in film (or life for that matter)?  They disrupt one‚Äôs  linear perception or flow or time.  What happens when space starts to resemble itself (with more mirrors)?  What happens when we encounter a hallway of mirrors, aka the crystal?  Linearity is disrupted and our notions of before and after break down.
Why does this matter?
One thing you learn watching image crystals is to suspend your judgment of images, because you will never know which aspect of an image will be selected for radical reworking later in the film. In this manner, each image becomes suffused with past/future, time, context, relation, and difference. It becomes virtual, less directly present, pure difference lurks between the very pores of the aspects of the image. What is present is an imaging of time, a depiction of time, of pure difference, in the image itself.
A direct imaging of time.

I think metahaven may have actually plotted this out on an x,y,z axis graph for clarity.  If not I‚Äôm going to do it

I‚Äôve never once conceived of mirrors as a destabilizing force that disrupts the tenuous linearity we construct to ensure that we can function as humans
Reactions
eyesglow
I think that people in are experiencing a rapidly accelerating amount of mirrors in their lives that create unintelligible complex prisms beyond comprehension.  With the free flow of infinite information, along with exposure to specific viewpoints creating ever more polarized experiences, the desire for linearity, non-mirrored, entertainment increases.
Reactions
I think this is a recursive pattern across time that signifies a great paradigm shift that eventually will be a common mode of understanding.  We seem to return to mirrorless linearity across history, but I often wonder if we will enter into a zone of comprehension in which time prisms are the norm of experiences.  If linear time is simply a mental construct, then a more real experience should be that of the hallway of mirrors.
Reactions
Eh try not to think about it and enjoy the film lol.  The characters are wonderful and the dilemma presented by the room at the heart of the zone, to me, is the dilemma of our time.
Tarkovsky‚Äôs balance of diagetic and non-diagetic sounds are mirrors of their own ‚ù§Ô∏è
Reactions
heart
do you feel your analysis is evident in the film itself? I started my academic curiosities as a film reviewer in high school and pursued film studies but found it to be complete incoherent garbage totally disconnected with my life ‚Äî and sometimes from the artist's own intent. There's a semi-famous story of an examination of the Frankenstein and its usage of black frames interspersed throughout the movie. I don't have the link to the actual article but it was called a compelling critique and the director came out and said "yeah we just screwed up putting together the final reel so there's missing frames that are black."
I'm very eager for a deeper connection to art, but I've been disappointed at some critical analysis bringing things to the art that's not there at all.
I‚Äôm curious if you think there‚Äôs space at all for bringing something outside the artists intent to the work. If the response/critical analysis is incoherent that‚Äôs an issue, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything inherently wrong with using contextual information outside the work to analyze it
Reactions
stancestrong
yeah I do agree there can often be analysis beyond the artist's intent. I think I subscribe to death of an author.
like did Verhoeven intend for Basic Instinct to be integral to sexual freedom and spotlighting bisexual characters? almost certainly not
I stated my understanding of Time Crystals, and tried to illustrate it beyond the dimension of film for clarity‚Äôs sake.  Images are never just images for Deleuze but if they are for you, I respect that.
Time *is* a purely mental construct, and linear perception is a result of how we structure the external world and our relationship to it.  The virtual is not merely the past, and memory, but also the future, and fantasy. I believe that access to the virtual is essential to human existence, and that the linear experience of external events in our daily lives can vastly limit our access to the virtual
I have no entry to Deleuze and if you intuit I have a position in relation to his view it is an unexamined one. I don't think I'm lost in what you've shared so far I'm just reminded of this XKCD

However Tarkovsky wrote extensively about his conceptions of time, and his intentions do align with a deleuzian or bergsonian analysis
I was giving an example to @idols.ico 's point that there can be critique that exists outside of artist's intent that is worthwhile. I think they were saying ‚Äî in response to my question on if your insight is present in the art ‚Äî that it doesn't have to be to be worthwhile.
Reactions
‚ù§Ô∏è
Gotcha!  That all being said, the analysis is definitely not why I like his movies. It‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve come to understand and agree with.  I do feel that time crystals, or disruptions in one‚Äôs linear perception of time really do allow for judgement and bias to be dispensed with, and a potential for openness to difference.  That‚Äôs huge.

I tend to appreciate artists in any medium who create these timeless, or perhaps detached virtual spaces. I see unlimited potential in those moments that are essential and frankly I‚Äôm sure most people do as well, even if not in those terms.

We shouldn‚Äôt let us be captured by schematizing machines

Do you believe that there‚Äôs a way by which to preserve certain aspects of industrial society while discarding of schematizing systems and/or constructs? I think of Zerzan‚Äôs writing on agriculture when attempting to confront the tyranny of the clock upon the foundations of human society, but that necessarily precludes any attempt at preserving the benefits of technological advancement
Oof tough, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way back, our minds and body and too shaped by it now to even comprehend living beyond it, except in like art, film, meditation, and drug circumstances.
I gotta read more zerzan
Reactions
doubt
But in some regard there‚Äôs always been a historic sense of organizing time
It‚Äôs just how absolute is it now
Despite a strong affection for theorists who are advocates of the liberatory potential of technology, my anti-tech sentiments inform much of my thinking regarding the deconstruction of entrenched behaviors and associated structures
Would you say that was even true in pre-agricultural societies? You can argue that time was far less regimented and specific behaviors were based upon reoccurring events (namely migratory patterns and the change of seasons) but such a conception of time stands in contrast to the conception that emerged from agricultural society
I kept this in mind throughout the entirety of the film and I found the manner by which Tarkovsky subtly manipulates the definition of a diagetic sound within the film to be a phenomenal - there are numerous instances where certain sounds are first made apparent to the viewer before the characters are made aware of it, alongside instances where it‚Äôs nearly impossible to discern if the characters can hear what exactly the audience is hearing
Reactions
ü§ç
That‚Äôs the beauty of the concepts like mirror hallways and time crystals.  I think what you‚Äôre describing affects the viewer‚Äôs perception of time with or without their knowledge of such.  That‚Äôs good filmmaking IMO. Tarkovsky masterfully lulls the viewer into virtual spaces, (or zones in the language of the film). Stalker is crafted in a way where I think numerous meaning can be inferred from our experience in the zone (of both the film experience itself and the location within).  It‚Äôs been a while but from what I recall he sees his viewers in the camp of the rational atheist skeptic, the spiritual believer (Christ consciousness), and the supernatural believer.  Each viewer can leave the film with a potent experience of meaning, even if they don‚Äôt share Tarkovsky‚Äôs own view of the world.
Reactions
heart
I‚Äôm in complete agreement, as those distinct sentiments and perspectives are present in each of the three characters or that each reflects a distinct perspective towards an entity such as the Zone
Awesome.  You‚Äôll find the same concepts across all of his films. Andrei Rublev really highlights these notions.
There also appears to exist a conflict between actions dictated by pure emotion and pure reason, whose consequences lead to meditation upon the circumstantial value of each sensation
Yeah.  The skeptical scientist (STEM), the famous cynical writer with writers block (liberal arts, humanities) and the stalker (persecuted christ, perhaps to a fault) all are at odds in how to resolve the question of the room.
Imagine being on the precipice of your inner most desire, only to know that you can never be certain of your truest desire.  Is our non-integrated shadow our truest expression?  The movie is intended to awaken the viewer to the knowledge that the terrain beyond their conscious mind is largely closed to them, and that it is there where their deepest desire smolders.  How can you ever be confident on what exactly is your deepest desire?

dang reading this made me like the film even more nice
I think the idea that *intelligence may be the ability to harness the powers of the surrounding world, without destroying it* is a profound concept to consider ‚Ä¶
Yeah it‚Äôs a haunting thought. I empathize tremendously with the characters and sometimes I think Tarkovsky was able to do a better job of what Hesse was attempting to do repeatedly with his novels, as they have similar character dilemmas at play.
Sorry I didn‚Äôt respond to the stuff above
But I wanted to respond here and say they‚Äôre both great but tarkovsky has the benefit of the dimension of space that film captures that writing can‚Äôt or I guess some poets grapple with that but Hesse doesn‚Äôt
The characters in stalker are moving as we move through a space neither of us have an understanding of, maybe it‚Äôs the brain itself the space of imagining, but we‚Äôre embodying it through the process of viewing

succession is as fun as the "expression" in dasha's eyes. good writing, but... also puzzled by the costumes and some of the interiors. you want to watch horrible ppl, there is much better out there to pick from.
What‚Äôs your favourite horrible ppl media?
@idols.ico let's see, going way back chorderlos de laclos' "dangerous liaisons". seinfeld was good, the grifters, the last temptation, romeo is bleeding, chinatown, body heat, borgman, funny games, in the company of men...
I think succession has great writing great acting and overall pretty well paced

The director of ‚ÄúLicorice Pizza‚Äù discusses his writing process, choosing actors, and how you can tell when you are on a good film set.
PTA had an interesting take - pretty much that maybe superhero movies can be a good life raft to keep the industry alive; as long as the category of ‚Äògoing to movies‚Äô still makes sense, there will be money kicking around for other, riskier shit to be made

I don‚Äôt think propaganda films such as the marvel movies have any relevance to art nowadays; maybe in the past such films were influential works,  but with the democratization of art I think these films can be completely ignored in a discussion of art or film

Yep.  I‚Äôd add that rarely are trilogies crafted across stretches of time, let alone decades in such a considered manner.  The kernel of the initial idea is explored as it unfolds across both lived and cinematic time, as opposed to the more typical trend of three films conceived and executed in relative succession.
Reactions
I just realized those three movies are the same director
Cronenberg been working forever
I think I‚Äôm the only person who enjoyed his performance in The Rover.  It was actually the first film I saw starring Pattinson.  I recall going to the theater to see something else that was sold out, so I wandered into an empty theater to see the other film playing, which happened to be The Rover.  I found him compelling in the role.
Certainly a flawed film, however the long soundless stretches of driving across barren desert with the basinski score was moving

Putting cosmopolis on the list after reading the chat
I think his most mainstream films are probably The Fly, Eastern Promises and A History of Violence.  Viggo Moretensen and Cronenberg are actually working together again for a new film, titled *Crimes of the Future.* (not a remake of his film of the same name from Cronenberg said he‚Äôs returning to his body horror roots for this one üëÄ.
*The synopsis details a future where humans have ‚Äúevolved beyond their natural state‚Äù and are able to alter their biological makeup. They adopt something called ‚ÄúAccelerated Evolution Syndrome,‚Äù which has been embraced by people like performance artist Saul Tenser (Mortensen) to grow new organs in his body‚Äîand he‚Äôs turned the removal of them into theater.*
The explicit theme of internal transformation is interesting given that it‚Äôs defined their last three films together.

The element of organ removal elevated to exhibitive spectacle reminds me of another film of Cronenberg‚Äôs, *Dead Ringers.*

I keep forgetting his entire latter half career. I was thinking of his stuff. But yeah you‚Äôre right Fly was a blockbuster
A lot of his work post videodrome is about exhibited spectacle/inhibited desire under mediated circumstances... and his movies take turns with his protagonist grappling with this internally and/or externally
I‚Äôve got to revisit his work after soon because it‚Äôs a blank spot in my studies of him

||like every sequel/reboot/revival is a pull between what fans expect and what the creator wants, and the movie was very clear about "i don't want to make this fucking movie and you probably don't want me too either." By putting that issue on the main character everyone likes, it allowed for the movie to be a lot more human about the whoring out of a beloved film for a cinematic universe. All that said, the action stuff is bad and it's attempt to be a proper sequel on top of trolling everyone didn't really work. Still, it was novel and interesting||

There were flashes of visual brilliance that reminded me of what was so amazing about the movie, but not enough for me really. Really missed Yuen Woo-Ping as choreographer - despite some impressive camera moments, the action stuff was really sub-par in this one

Our culture is glitching, looping, stuck in some long, static interregnum. So is ‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections.‚Äù
> Especially because the original Matrix, as imagined by sororal duo Lilly and Lana Wachowski, felt genuinely inventive. It blended Terminator-styled dystopian sci-fi with Hong Kong wire-fu action and state-of-the-art special effects, all draped in the industrial liveries of a turn-of-the-millennium goth club. It may not have been wholly new. But it was thrilling remix. It spoke to the ennui of America at the ‚Äúend of history.‚Äù It captured the soul-deadening, Dilbert-esque daily doldrums explored in films like Fight Club and Office Space. It also played straight to the anxiety around and the mounting cultural panic that home computers and toaster ovens might break down or turn against their owners. The Matrix felt like it was speaking to its time. Now, movies seem to chatter only among themselves.

The director quote about using the film as a step out of depression after the death of their parents, and having to be haggled by the cast to finish shooting during COVID signaled to me that it in aggregate, it was probably more fun to make than it would be to watch (pass)
I came up with at least compelling sequels that would have been better while watching the movie.  I really can‚Äôt believe how it ended, just such a lazy mess.

hey probs been asked a times but does anyone know where you can watch Arguing The World for free?
Do you guys think the shot-by-shot stuff at the start intentionally looks worse then the original (would sort of make sense in the context of the story) or does it just show the decline in film making standards from the
Hard to say, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intentional. That gives the director too much credit.  It was more disappointing than anything else.  Even if we had to keep the story there are so many better ways to shoot it. I assume wachowski‚Äôs hands were partly tied to mediocre concepts. If not, then shame on them.

i had a lot of fun w/ them playing with the meta stuff
i am fully a wachowski apologist and big fan of the contemporary novelist david mitchell tho
lana david and this other guy wrote matrix
I feel you. I usually can appreciate what they do. I just think there could have been an actual message relevant to today in there this isn‚Äôt a grudge beating critique on the state of the industry
um the message is that you are NOT crazy if you have revelations of a higher order world, in fact your blue framed glasses psychiatrist is a part of the plot
and your chewable blue tablets only keep you down
Audio is very shoddy for me
Only getting the highest registers
Oh I think it's just coming from Josh's audio
I think I figured it out on my end
|| Why on earth was there a massive Twitter campaign illustrating the matrix series as a trans allegory (as a marketing tool) only to sorta drop that message?  It‚Äôs very convoluted. I mean towards the end neo can‚Äôt Fly, trinity can, and then at the very end somehow they both can fly?   I don‚Äôt understand how that ties into the original metaphor unless they represent both sides of the gender binary living in unity.  What‚Äôs beyond the binary truly is non-dualism;  meaning in this case a sense of harmony and unity that penetrates biological gender.  At least that‚Äôs the impression I‚Äôve gotten from reading the Wachowski‚Äôs interviews across the years. I couldn‚Äôt find that at all in the film.  Also, I don‚Äôt think the entire field of therapy should be written off.  I‚Äôm getting tired of that meme.
Also I almost KMS when White Rabbit started to play. The first film was very in your face with the metaphors but at least not that bad. If we‚Äôre leaning on previously established metaphors, it seems insane but perhaps the obviousness was just a massive fuck you to executive producers asking for the metaphors to be clearer. ||
That being said David I respect your POV and look forward to you changing my own. I haven‚Äôt given the film much thought beyond my initial reactions.
I hated it
I thought it was more that the matrix wasn't an allegory it's actually a love story
But it was just so meta in a soy way and with lots of wedon style dialogue
Idk how you guys can acknowledge the movie clearly is a self-own about its own existence and then critique it for not continuing specific allegories from past movies. Wachowski seems clear that they resent the idea anyone would prescribe to the creator of the story what it‚Äôs really about. There‚Äôs a reason they had no desire to return to the franchise after Revelations and it‚Äôs because they had no interest in that whole process.
Reactions
I hear you but that‚Äôs not my POV. I thought that the creators intentionally brought the trans metaphor to light during the promotional press junket, as a narrative thread to tie all four films together. I was commenting that I didn‚Äôt see that in the film despite how often it was discussed by the cast and creator, after David mentioned his understanding of the higher level metaphor.  There where a lot of hands involved in the final edit so it is what it is.  Anyways I rate the film bag of popcorn and four middle fingers
oh i didnt consume any promotional stuff
it seemed like the movie specifically derided the idea it was a trans metaphor
Yeah, I know. Odd given the insistence that the original series was firmly a trans allegory
i tend to subscribe to the view they made a trans metaphor but didn't really intend to
Yeah totally. Perhaps it was less conscious at the time, as during the first film neither of the creators had transitioned.  Lana pretty much confirms that here, but in other interviews goes harder in it always being their intention.

Re: matrix I'm curious about the Lily/ Lana working partnership since Resurrections is Lana only. That seems to suggest that Lana was more concept+ actor oriented and Lily did more of the heavy lifting when it came to the action side- anyone know if there's any truth to that?

It came out with the brutal and violent wave of films right after the viet nam war officially ended. Interesting to consider it was the last war that america really televised the deceased returning from war in coffins along with publishing violent imagery from the war.  Propaganda has certainly changed in response to the anti-war movement that was polarized by said imagery.  It‚Äôs also a response to the socio economic climate of Manhattan / Times Square of the time
New York was starting to collapse
Consider films like Dirty Harry in this vein along with most of Sam peckinpah‚Äôs oeuvre
Peckinpah is very interesting in that he theorized that extremely violent movies would prove to be a catharsis for the wounded ego, broken image and internal conflict of post viet nam war era america.  (He basically invented slow motion action sequences.)  sadly towards the end of this life he concluded his career was a failure in that he simply helped feed and expand the appetite for violence in American cinema.  I think some of his films would probably really resonate with the cell.

that's funny because i'm told that's easily the weakest of the three, but still good apparently
There‚Äôs really something to his films in which he would cast older actors known for Embodying an ideal type of masculinity in a previous era. He‚Äôd place them in a Fin de sicle environment in which their old values would be confronted by the ideals of a new time.  The Wild Bunch exemplifies this narrative to a dispiriting yet poignant degree.

At least that‚Äôs what I see in some of his best work.  Perhaps this is the through line to other violent films of the time like Taxi Driver.

Death Wish helped kick off this trend / tendency too; speaking to a post-counterculture fears / frustration - not just around urban decline / drug derangement but the paranoia inspired by the Zodiac Killer, Manson, etc.  Interesting though it feels like Death Wish's dissonant soundtrack really gives a sense of 'wrongness' to the protagonist's embrace of violence, it's a decidedly dark turn.  But in addition to dark / gritty / nihilistic dramas it basically started the violent action movie trend, which quickly shed the dark / paranoid atmospherics

For sure, there‚Äôs a handful of films from that era tied to the new wave of extreme violence that really exemplified the concept

Any suggestions for good films to watch with friends?
 colleen
what vibe you looking for
Trying to compile a list of films to show to friends, one each week of the semester, throughout the duration of the term
I'm not sure, I've created a tentative list, but I'm not sure that it'll be conducive to watching with others
 colleen
ooh wait lemme see the list
 colleen
So i like know what currently is in question
 colleen
This cell, including me, is guilty of tism stolen valor
The list consists of:
Field (*Redacted*) (Khalik Allah)
Bande  part (Godard)
Three Colors: Blue (Kieslowski)
Taste of Cherry (Kiarostami)
Fallen Angels (Wong)
Beau Travail (Denis)
Cleo from to (Varda)
Au Revoir Les Enfants (Malle)
Naked (Leigh)
The Color of Pomegranates (Parajanov)
La Haine (Kassovitz)
Blue Velvet (Lynch)
Don't Look Now (Roeg)
Some of these are personal favorites but the majority are films I haven't seen yet
I plan to include Tati's *Playtime* as well
Color of Pomegranates is a such a good watch but it‚Äôs v abstract
 no
Traffic is the better Tati film
Don't know if it's necessarily the vibe but I watched the film Perfumed Nightmare the other night. Highly recommend.
 no
I would recommend adding Manto (Nandita Das) to the list

Ramen movie. It‚Äôs good vibes
It's been in my watchlist for a long time, I'll make sure to add it
Another Japanese movie that I think is sick is Branded to Kill but my friends thought it sucked
Depends on ur group I guess but I think you should still watch it by yourself at least bc it rocks
Tampopo is so good
Hausu is another quirked up Japanese movie I love
I've watched some of Hausu and found it to be ok, but I wasn't able to finish it
I'm not exactly sure what the unifying aspect of all of the films I've selected is
Also The Seventh Seal if you guys haven‚Äôt

seems like you're interested in the euro art house canon. I'd add dardenne brothers & thomas vinterberg - the celebration as picks. I think you'd have fun with maoist era Godard, before he goes full video essay.
The majority of the films that I've watched or intend to watch are of that tradition - I'm trying to diversify my own taste, but it's a challenge when I still haven't seen many of the most well-respected and acclaimed films within the Art House canon. On the topic of Godard, I've watched three of his films and left each feeling relatively unaffected and apathetic - it may just be his pacing, but I find it challenging to fully immerse myself within much of his work. While I did enjoy Masculin Feminin (It being most recent engagement with his work), I found myself distracted and unable to appreciate the dialogue and thematic content to the extent that I'd like.
Weekend and Pierre Le fou might break what you‚Äôre describing.

gonna go ahead and out myself as an Allen apologist. Only in the sense that when it works, it really works, and works so well that I am comfortable separating what are indisputably essential contributions to the art form from his garbage personal life and pathetic late career.

I've watched a surprising amount but also throw titles into various lists to watch / study later.  It was sort of a proto-Are.na-project in that way; and some of the lists are thematically / topically rigorous, but a lot are more aesthetic / moodboarding /speculation

A huge reason as to why I‚Äôm fascinated by Tarkovsky‚Äôs films is largely in part in which his films compare and reflect the broader time frame he was creating his films in the USSR. It‚Äôs spiritual meditation on time, nature, and the individual are indicative of a nation and the morale of an entire society crippled by economic turmoil, policies losses on the world political stage, and a growing number of people losing faith in institutionalized religion. Tarkovsky‚Äôs films give me an interesting juxtaposition as to the current state of American culture and politics with a increasing divide between the two political parties
Reactions
compass
Such a good film. Will never forget seeing the scene from your top screenshot for the first time. So unexpected and truly unnerving, but still felt utterly personal and intimate. Sometimes the films are so personal that they feel sealed up to Tarkovsky himself, but of course they can't help but mirror (pun intended) the cultural moment around him.
Have you seen last film The Sacrifice? Sort of a nuclear-fear reaction film, but it feels particularly relevant today the way he portrays the loss of meaning and return to spiritualism/magic in the face of a life-threatening event.
While we're on the thread of Russian cinema, anyone here seen the Dau series by Ilya Khrzhanovskiy? IMO One of the grandest experiments in modern cinema. The second half of Degeneration is particularly interesting, when the Russian neo-nazi Maxim Martsinkevich joins the Dau institute

Dau degeneration was horrifying. I‚Äôve been meaning to watch the rest of the series. A family member who lived in the eastern bloc said it does a good job of capturing the general vibe of living under a dictatorship
Yeah the back story on the former KGB officer conducting interrogations is wild too. From what I remember he was imprisoned for a long while in the Soviet Union for torture. So I get that it captures the paranoia of the eastern bloc.
The other films in the series are basically character studies - Nora Mother was a really intimate portrait. Same with Natasha, though it was equally horrifying as degeneration. The others kinda suck IMO

IMO It‚Äôs more about having to be a closeted Christian during a time when religion and faith are violently repressed.  Stalker is a Christian Allegory set in the heart of the ‚Äúevil empire.‚Äù
Critically acclaimed film at the time of its release that I feel has aged wonderfully and deserves the continued praise.  Great Brando era before his epic decline
Reactions
Tarkovsky was deeply affected by this having grown up with his poet father who had an immense love of Christ.  His father‚Äôs poetry became distilled into the Stalker‚Äôs monologues, mixed with various passages from the Bible that reference Christ.

Transformers: The Premake by  Kevin B. Lee
YouTube videos are transformed into a critical investigation of the global big budget film industry, amateur video making, and the political economy of images.
Fraud by Dean Fleischer-Camp
A family's home movies document a desperate crime spree and the bid to outrun the consequences. Born from a colossal trove of innocuous uploads to YouTube, Fraud is an impressionistic meta-fiction thriller that reveals one family's struggle for the American Dream and the mutability of the stories we tell online. (This is one of my all time favorites)
Reactions

When I watched this film recently, and in reference to these stills, I think about his concept of ‚Äúimprints in time‚Äù. That these images he created on film are from his childhood memories, so visceral and psychologically present in him, that the viewer also feels the memories are their own, or that they have very similar memories.

Love ancient evenings. Book and the film
I was one of those nerds who sat through the entire screening at BAM.  He definitely could have broken it up into segments like cremaster tho

I always think of children of men
But maybe like hyperstition

Adam Curtis is the bomb dot com.
Watched the day of the lotus tonight. Crazy ending
You really should, I think you‚Äôd appreciate Curtis‚Äô POV.  Josh has screened *The Century of the Self* which was well received by the community.  It‚Äôs a great place to start as well as *Bitter Lake* and especially *Hypernormalization.* I imagine Curtis‚Äô work has had some influence in the trajectory as to how I and many others ended up in this space.
Here‚Äôs most of his work. https://thoughtmaybe.com/by/adam-curtis/
Watch them all
My favourites are hypernormalization and can‚Äôt get you out of my head

He‚Äôs like a libertarian ?

Something of that flavour for sure
When Runaway starts hitting in Bitter Lake :joker_leto:
In my head I imagine his politics are like if morissey was a little cooler
I have a big hot take I want to drop about Kimi, have people watched that yet?
drop it
I was very interested in it initially as sort of "in this reality" representation of pod life,
movie looks terrible imo im not gonna watch it
I wanna flesh it out more, I'll be back.

was it good or bad
It's a movie about a woman who is scared to go outside, then she goes outside and is chased by one short man and one tall man, violence ensues, then the lesson she learns is that she can go outside after all if she has a boyfriend.

they only have part out.  i kept thinking what is like to be a person that  had a documentarian following him at such early stages. i guess if you see yrself as important as a christian god it makes sense.
p. interesting stuff nonetheless.

how many of those early scenes do you think were pseudo re-enactments? I kept thinking about how the guy documenting hadn't done anything before this but like man on the street stuff/skit comedy.
interesting. but he looks so much younger?
Maybe reenactment is the wrong word, re-staged ?

I watched in theaters
seeing that movie trailer a few months back made me feel a little crazy
Watching it in the theater was weird. It had some weird right wing moments.
huh that is weird
totally thought it was gonna be like way more lib for some reason
or at least play it a little less straight w that title??
There‚Äôs like a montage of him trying to pick up girls in Portland Oregon and when he says he‚Äôs a veteran they‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh so you have a white savior complex‚Äù
So it felt like it was really trying to win over the anti-woke audience.
It unfortunately was not very funny. And the dog and him never cuddle all that much.
I hope one of them had blue hair
